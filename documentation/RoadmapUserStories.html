Kathy was afraid that learning to program would be hard.<br/>But learning Hum turned out to be easy.<br/>"It is just like writing down a recipe!<br/>Anyone can do it!"

Rosa is using Hum to design her dream house.<br/>"I just describe the rooms
<br/>and the viewer shows me what it will look like. 
<br/>I can move around and adjust the details too.<br/>If I want to change the counter-top material,
<br/>I just touch it and say a few words."

Benny re-costumed the house greeter to look like Jeeves. <br/>Somebody re-costumed Benny's avatar to look like Wooster.<br/>Mom was amused.  
<br/>At least the pranks had a little class.
<br/>But she restricted the virtual house scenery anyway.

Jennie learned the S-curve

Larry ran simulations
<br/>to discover the best ratios
<br/>between the smart-dust ears and eyes.
<br/>The ears detected gun-shots.
<br/>The eyes moved-in to get pictures.
<br/>"Some day this will be real." Larry said.

The stock re-ordering neural-net
<br/> was having trouble 
<br/>adjusting to the big tourist events. <br/>Robert provided it with a schedule of those events
<br/>so it would know what was causing the problem.
<br/>The simulation showed the effect of the new training.<br/>The predicted inventory behavior looked much better.</td>

People are installing solar generators, 
<br/>switching to ground-heat,
<br/>driving hybrids unless they are telecommuting,
<br/>and the carbon market is fluctuating! 
<br/>Five simultaneous trends!
<br/>What should our strategy be?<br/>The planning team went to work on the market model
<br/>and added moves to the strategy mix.<br/>When they ran the simulations, 
<br/>some things were clear
<br/>and some things were not.

"It doesn't happen very often," 
<br/>the process owner said, 
<br/>"but eventually we should automate the steps 
<br/>for when the customer cancels the order."
<br/>"Can we defer that to the next release?" said the analyst.<br/>"Yes, the existing 'freeze and step' 
<br/>micro-manager feature 
<br/>is a good-enough solution for now."</td>
