<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  This section provides and overview of the Hum language and system. 
</p>
<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>
   Hum and the Hum <i>run-time system</i> "Rube"
   are designed to make it possible to write useful programs 
   in as natural a language as possible.
   The language notation is designed to allow all <i>instructions</i>
   to be written as simple English statements.
   The syntax is completely relaxed.
   While there are certain recommended forms, 
   they are mainly a matter of style 
   - to assure consistency and readability.
</p>
<h3>Notations</h3>
<p> 
   While Hum is designed with a relaxed and natural syntax,
   Hum is still a programming language;
   and thus, it is still a set of <i>notations</i>.
   The notations are designed to allow one to express an idea
   in a way that is clear, brief, and reasonably natural.
   Rather than designing notations that are convenient 
   for the translation software,
   we have designed a set of notations that are convenient
   for the human authors and readers.
</p>
<h3>Frames</h3>
<p>
  One does not so much &nbsp; <i>program</i> &nbsp; the Hum system 
  as &nbsp; <i>advise</i> &nbsp; it.
  <br />Different kinds of advice are given in different types of <i>frames</i>.
  <ul>
   <li>Task frames - explain how <i>goals</i> and <i>actions</i> are related.</li>
   <li>Role frames - explain how a <i>role</i> accomplishes assigned <i>actions</i>.</li>
   <li>Dictionary frames - define the <i>operational meaning</i> of nouns.</li>
   <li>Dialog frames - show how to carry on a conversation with a user.</li>
   <li>View frames - show how to present data about a specific subject.</li>
   <li>Data frames - provide a notation for communnicating data.</li>
  </ul> 
  Frames are explained in some detail in the
  <a href="FrameTypes.html" title="Frame Types">Frame Types</a>
  section.
</p>
<h3>Actors</h3>
<p>
  <i>Actors</i> provide the connection between <i>role frames</i> and reality.
  A real-world actor might be a human being or a robot of some type.
  (In this context, a robot could be any programmable device.)
  A virtual-world actor might be an avatar or a simulation of a robot.
  Thus, an actor provides the connection to real-world reality
  or to a virtual reality. 
</p>
<p>Actors are assigned to one or more <i>roles</i>.
   The only requirement for an actor is that it can "understand" 
   any <i>action statement</i> in the <i>action frames</i> 
   that are related to an assigned role.  
</p>
<p>Actors may be programmed outside of the Hum system.
   Thus, they might be programmed in any appropriate programming language. 
   Human actors are generally trained (not programmed)
   and will understand the Hum instructions directly.
</p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>
   The Simple run-time system is designed to operate in a business environment.
   Accordingly, it contains the necessary subsystems 
   to track inventories of <i>resources</i> and account for their use.
   The system even includes a light-weight accounting system.
</p>
<p>Resources are allocated from <i>resource pools</i> as needed.
   If the resources are parts and material, 
     you can think of such a pool as an inventory.  
   Actors are resources and they are allocated from pools also.
   If the actors are humans, 
     you can think of such a pool as a staffing pool.
</p>
<h3>Simulations and Games</h3>
<p>
   If the actors are operating in a virtual reality,
     we are running a simulation.
   The purpose of the simulation might be 
     to tune-up a business process,
     to study an ecology,
     or to operate a gaming environment.     
</p>
<p>Hum does not (at this time) include a notation 
   for specifying virtual world <i>landscapes</i>.
   But the Hum notations are sufficient 
   for defining the defense strategies 
   in single-player and multi-player games.
