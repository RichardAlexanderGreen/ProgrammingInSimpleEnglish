<h1>Writing Applications in Hum</h1>

<h2>Applications are created by informing, not programming.</h2>
<p>
   You do not really program the Hum system.
   Instead you tell the system what it needs to know to write its own programs.
   Accordingly, authoring an application mainly involves 
     identifying the goals of the application
	 and then providing the knowledge required
	 by the system to achieve each goal. 
</p>
<p>	 
   In general, the system determines what is missing
   by examining what you have told it so far
   and identifying things you have mentioned
   but not yet explained.	
   Thus, the system might not know that a goal is missing,
   but, it will know when the plan for a known goal is incomplete.   	 
</p>
<p>
  
</p>

<h2>Capturing Business Process Knowledge</h2>
<p>
The Hum <i>framework</i> is designed, from the ground up,
 to <i>implement</i> 
and <i>simulate</i> business processes. 
The framework can be used for other purposes, 
but it is easiest to understand 
when viewed in the context of a <i>business process</i>.
</p>
<h3>Fulfilling an Order</h3>
<p>
The fundamental business process is fulfilling an order. 
An order is the triggering event. 
Fulfilling the order is the goal of the business system. 
Everything else flows from the order.
Resources are marshaled, allocated, assigned, used, and accounted. 
The customer is billed for the service performed or product delivered, 
funds are collected.
The metrics of the enterprise are continuously monitored.
</p>
<h3>Example Scenario - A Donut Shop</h3>
<p>
To illustrate how the system works, 
  consider the following <b>scenario</b>:
Our enterprise is operating a donut shop. 
Customers buy donuts and coffee. 
We offer a variety of donuts and coffees. 
We will describe our business processes from the top down. 
Along the way, 
  we will note the different <i>entities</i> involved 
  - the roles, the resources, the products.
This scenario is partially described in the top-level task frame shown in 
<a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a>.

<p><i>
This is not the time to worry about the realism or efficiency 
of this business process 
or the related business policies. 
This example is for illustration. 
In fact, it contains some deliberate errors.
Later, we will show how processes get refined and how policies are changed.
</i></p>

<h3>The Task Frame</h3>

<p class="ADVICE">
<i>
Read the following paragraph carefully. 
<br />It contains a dense description of the main concepts of Hum.
</i>
</p>
<p>
The <i>top-level task frame</i> defines the <i>goal</i> of the <i>plan</i> in its <i>post-condition</i>.
The post-condition is labeled "Post" in the frame. 
However, 
  before the work of serving the customer can begin, 
  we need to know what the customer wants. 
Therefore, 
  a <i>precondition</i> is that the customer has entered an order. 
It is also our policy to collect payment in advance. 
So, that is one of the preconditions also. 
Once the preconditions (labeled "Pre" in the task frame) are satisfied, 
  we perform a sequence of <i>actions</i>
  with the end result being that the post-condition, the goal, is achieved.
Each action is a procedure performed by a specific <i>role</i>.
The actions performed by a role are detailed in a <i>role frame</i>.
</p>

<h4>Defining Sub-processes</h4>
<p>
Now that the primary goal and its prerequisites 
  and transitional actions are identified,
  we can define the prerequisite sub-processes indicated by the preconditions. 
We will write more task frames to show how the preconditions are satisfied. 
We will also write <i>role frames</i> (sets of procedures) to define the actions performed by various roles.
</p>
<p>
Assume for now that we always have <i>actors</i> on hand that can understand the <i>instructions</i> in the role frame. When the system is running, the roles are assigned to humans, robots, or simulated actors (sim-bots).
</p>

<p>Here is an <b>action procedure:</b></p>

<a name="Figure_2"></a>
<table border="1" cellpadding="9" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>
    <h4>Figure 2: Role Frame - Provide detailed instructions for actors assigned to a role.</h4>
<pre class="EXAMPLE">
Role: Coffee-Mixer.    (Coffee-Mixer is the name of a role.)
Action: Prepare the coffee-items in the order.  
. Get a coffee-tray from the coffee-tray-stacker.
. For each coffee-item in order:
. . Prepare the coffee-item.       		
. . Add coffee-item to coffee-tray.		
. . Bookkeeper: Add coffee-item value to coffee-tray inventory.
. Move coffee-tray to outgoing-coffee-queue.	

To: Prepare the coffee-item.                  
. Fetch recipe's cup from cup-dispenser. 
. Execute coffee-item's assembly-process.
. (The assembly-process is the coffee-item recipe.)
. (The assembly-process will account for materials and equipment costs.)

To: Get container from stacker.
. Move to stacker's location.
. Remove container from stacker. 
</pre>
     </td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Here are some of the points of interest in the action procedure shown in 
<a href="#Figure_2">Figure 2</a>:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <i>role</i> is called "Coffee-Mixer". 
      When the <i>action</i> is performed,
	    the <i>actor</i> could be a human, or a robot, or a sim-bot.
	  </li>
  <li>The term role might also be thought of as synonymous with <i>actor</i>. 
      A single person or a single robot could be performing multiple roles in our scenario. 
	  <i>
	  (If you thought our coffee-shop was over-staffed, 
	     you should now understand that a single person could be doing everything.)
	  </i>
	  </li>
  <li>The action is defined with a <i>action-procedure</i> 
      - directly under the "Action" label.
	  </li>
  <li>That action-procedure contains a "For each" statement. 
      This type of statement provides a way to iterate over the items in a collection. 
	  In this case, the order contains a collection of order-items.
	  </li>
  <li>The action-procedure refers to a <i>sub-procedure</i> 
        called "Prepare the coffee item."
      </li>
  <li>That sub-procedure is associated in a with a "To" label 
      and defined in a block of statements that follow the To-label.
      </li>
  <li>The main procedure <i>delegates</i> the book-keeping work to another actor, called "Bookkeeper".
      </li>
  <li>The instruction "Get a coffee-tray from the coffee-tray-stacker."
        is detailed under: "To: Get container from stacker." 
        ... This illustrates the use of <i>supertypes</i>.
        A coffee-tray is a kind of container.
        A coffee-tray-stacker is a kind of stacker.
        The relationships between supertypes and subtypes are defined 
          in <i>dictionary frames</i>.
      </li>
</ul>

<h4>Run-Time Semantics</h4>
<p>
Since the procedures are written in Hum, 
they can be understood equally well by humans, robots, and sim-bots. 
When we run the actual business, 
the procedures are executed by humans and/or robots.
When we simulate the operation of the business, 
  the procedure actions are performed by <i>sim-bots</i>. 
The same system can be used to operate the business in the real world 
  or in a virtual world. 
In fact,
 we may want to test our business processes in the virtual world 
   before running them in the real-world.
</p>

<h3>Where are the variables?</h3>
<p>
If you are a programmer, you may be wondering how the <i>variables</i> 
  are indicated in the procedures.  
In a natural language sentence, the <i>nouns</i> denote variables.
Nouns are almost always abstract concepts whose meaning depends on context.
Only proper nouns denote a specific instance of an object. 
</p>
<h4>Filling in the Blanks</h4>
<p>
Variables in a programming language are essentially blanks (slots) 
  to be filled-in at run-time.
Using the language of math, 
  we would say that the system substitutes specific values for the variables
  in the formulae.  
</p>
<p>
When humans are given procedures,
   they map the nouns to specific <i>objects</i> in their environment
   based on context and experience.
But sim-bots are just bots and they need a little help with the mapping.
There are two things involved here: mapping and context.
</p>
<p>
<b>Mapping:</b>
Nouns refer to <i>entities</i> and the <i>attributes</i> of entities.
Dictionary entries map nouns to built-in concepts.
In Hum, the <i>dictionary</i> entries identify which nouns are entities
and which are attributes.
In addition to data-level concepts like entity and attribute,
  the framework contains higher level concepts including:
  <br/>- role
  <br/>- resource
  <br/>- resource pool
  <br/>- location
  <br/>- measure
</p>

<p>
<b>Context:</b>
At run time, the nouns in the statements are mapped to specific objects.
A <i>plan</i> is assembled to satisfy a specific <i>goal</i>.
All of the nouns in that plan 
  are then interpreted in the context of that goal 
  and the <i>world</i> in which the plan is operating.
Some objects are defined in the goal. 
For example, a specific order (product) and customer (client, person)
  might be referenced in the <i>post-condition</i> of the top-most task frame.
Other nouns may refer to the environment.
For example, they may refer to specific <i>resources</i> 
  including equipment, materials, workspaces, and actors.
</p>
<p>
When a Hum system wakes up, its memory of the world is read 
  from a kind of database that we call a world-base.
The memory of the world changes as the instructions 
  in the frames are executed by various actors.
The world-base maintains records of what-is and what-happened.  
</p>
<p>
Consider the instruction:
<code> . Add flavors shown in item recipe.</code>
<br/>The nouns are "flavors", "item", and "recipe".
The system already knows that "item" refers to an "order item"
and that an <i>order item</i> will refer to a <i>product</i>
and that a product may have a <i>bill-of-material</i>
and an assembly-process.
We need to explain "flavors" and "recipe".
The relevant dictionary entries are:
</p>
<pre class="EXAMPLE">
---
Dictionary:
. A flavor is a material.
. Recipe is a synonyn for assembly-process.
---
</pre>
<p>
These dictionary entries map the nouns to lower-level concepts
that are "understood" by the system. 
In this case, the item is in the order that is referenced in the original goal.
The item, in turn, implicitly references a recipe.
The recipe is an assembly-process defined by a task frame in the ontology.
The sim-bots will read the bill-of-materials
and draw "flavor" <i>material</i> from appropriate <i>resource pools</i>.
</p>
<pre class="example">
---
Dictionary: Bill-of-Materials concepts.
. Product is described by name, bill-of-materials, assembly-process.
. . (The "assembly-process" names a task-frame in the ontology.)
. A bill-of-materials contains a list of component-quantities. 
. A component-quantity is described by a component and a quantity.
. A part is a component.
. A material is a component.

</pre>
 
<h2>Elaborating the Example</h2>
<p>
A version "0.1" elaboration of the Donut Shop's business process is in 
the "<a href="DonutShopV01Linked.html">DonutShopV01</a>" listing. 
This is a good time to examine the listing.
The elaboration is fairly detailed, 
but there are still some inconsistencies
and some missing bits.
That will help us show how the system catches errors.
</p>
<p> 
In <a href="RunningTheBusiness.html">Running the Business</a>,
we will explain how the system operates (or simulates) a business.
