  Task frames provide a way to reduce a complicated problem
    to a set of simpler problems.
  The goal or post-condition of the task 
    is indicated by the statement after the "Post" label.
  The sub-goals or pre-conditions 
  that need to be satisfied to enable the task
    are listed under the "Pre" label.
</p>
<p>
  The task "Serve buttered toast" cannot be worked
    until the bread is sliced and the butter is melted.
  So, we have the pre-conditions:
    "Bread is sliced"
    and "Butter is melted." 
  Note that these pre-condition tasks can be worked in parallel.  
</p>
<p>
  The original goal links to two sub-goals or pre-conditions 
    that must be satisfied first.
  When those sub-goals are met,
    we can work on the actions required to get from the pre-conditions
    to the post-condition.
  For example, to get from
   "Bread is sliced" and "Butter is Melted"
   to
   "Buttered toast is on the plate."  
  The actions are: 
    "Cook: Butter the toast" 
    and 
    "Server: Move loaded-plate to patron's table."  
</p>
<p>
  The "Butter the toast" action is assigned to a role called "Cook."  
  The role-frame labeled "Role: Cook" defines some of the things 
    that an actor assigned to the "Cook" role should know how to do.
  In this case, the role-frame includes the actions called:
    "Butter the toast" and "Slice the bread."  
  Under "Deliver toast" we find a series of steps - instructions to the cook.
</p>
<p>
  The final action in the task frame, 
  "Move loaded plate to table"
    is assigned to the "Server" role.
  When the actor assigned to the server role completes that action,
    the original goal "Buttered toast delivered to patron" 
    is satisfied.
