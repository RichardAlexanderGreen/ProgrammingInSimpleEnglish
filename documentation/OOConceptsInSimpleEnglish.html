<p class="AUTHOR">
   I wrote this relatively early in the design and implementation
   as a means to clarify some concepts in my own mind.
   <br/>2008.11.02 - The document is serving that purpose well.
   I have come back to it
   to clarify some tricky problems
   that I am having designing the dialog mechanisms.
   <br/>- This document also serves to identify some of the features
   that the Hum translaters and interpreters must have
   to satisfy those (myself included) 
   who require a framework that implements "object-oriented" concepts.
   
</p>
<h1>Object-Oriented Concepts in Hum</h1>

<p>
In object oriented programming languages, 
programs are assembled from compilation units called class files. 
An execution is typically invoked by starting a "main" procedure 
that is defined in one particular class file. 
The "main" class is indicated on a command line. 
The class containing the main procedure is instantiated
and then other classes referenced by that class and by the main
procedure are instantiated as needed. 
An equivalent idea is that a master process instantiates threads in response to system events. 
Each thread has an action class with a "run" or "start" procedure that is like a main procedure. 
Different system events are mapped to different action classes.
</p>
<p>
In Hum, 
  an execution is started in response to the setting of a <i>goal</i>. 
The <i>plan</i> for achieving the goal is assembled from <i>task frames</i> (figure 1). 
Task frames define the pre-conditions that must be met before a goal (a post-condition) can be met. 
A plan is created by back-chaining through the pre-conditions. 
</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="9" cellspacing="0">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td valign="top">
<b>Figure 1:</b> This is a task frame.
<br/>- Task frames are assembled to create plans.		
<br/>- The (get: ...) comments indicate the data that is implicitly referenced.
<pre class="EXAMPLE">
Task: Satisfy client's goal.         (get: client, goal)
Post: Client's goal is satisfied.
Pre: 
. Plan developed to satisfy goal.    (get: plan, goal)
. Plan approved by client.
Actions:
. Manager: Execute plan on behalf of client.      
. Billing: Add costs of plan to client's account. (get: costs, account) 
---
</pre>
        
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>
A task frame may also have a sequence of <i>actions</i>. 
An <i>action</i> is a process to be performed by some <i>actor</i>. 
Actions are defined in <i>role action frames</i>. (figure 2) 
Since a role is performed by a specific actor, 
 and an actor may perform more than one role, 
 actions are collated by <i>role</i>. 
In this way, an action is equivalent to a method in a class declaration.

</p>
<p> 
Actions are defined in a syntax that that includes block statements
such as If-Else, For-Each, and With.
Actions may reference other actions.  
This provides readability and while retaining the power of a procedural language.
</p>
<p class="ADVICE">
  While Hum provides role-action frames to define the details
  and operational meaning of an action statement,
  one should carefully consider which instructions
  belong in the ontology of the client business process
  and which belong in the ontology (programming-framework) of the actor.
</p>
<p class="AUTHOR"> 
  The desk-check experiments and the examples shown in the programmer's guide
  do not deal with this question.
  <b>
  I need to write some actor-side code to properly investigate this issue.

<p>
On the surface, 
  Hum does not look like an object oriented language. 
  But, object oriented concepts do apply in Hum. 
  In fact, most object-oriented concepts apply in natural language (written English); we just don't think about natural language in that way.
</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Objects are categorized as: Entities, Attributes, and Relationships
	   <br>These distinctions are useful for defining the syntax of the language 
	       and the organization of the persistence layer (system memory). 
    </li>
  <li>Entities may have subtypes - which inherit their attributes and behavior.
    </li>
  <li>Polymorphism (superseding methods) allows a sentence to apply to the subtypes and synonyms of a noun.
	</li>
  </ul>
<!-- ................................................................... -->
  
<h3>Entities, Attributes, Events, and Relationships</h3>
<p>
In the world of Object-Oriented-Programming (OOP), 
  everything is potentially treated as an object. 
This is particularly true in a language like C++ or Smalltalk.
But, as a practical matter, some things are more object-like than others. 
In Hum, 
  where the emphasis is on business problems, 
  the concepts from Entity Relationship Analysis (ERA) are very effective. 
In fact, 
  Hum is delivered "off-the-shelf"  
  with certain Entities pre-packaged (built-in)
  complete with attributes, events, relationships, and methods. 
By examining these pre-packaged objects, 
 we can quickly show how object-oriented concepts are applied in Hum.

<p>
<b>Entities and Attributes:</b> 
An <i>entity</i> is characterized by its name, and a set of <i>attributes</i>. 
In simple structural terms, an entity is a thing that has attributes. 
While <i>attributes</i> are typically simple descriptors (strings), 
  they can also be entities in their own right.
</p>

Dictionary: Party pattern.
. A party has attributes including name, alphabetized-name, address, phone.
. Address attributes include address-line-1, address-line-2, city, state,
. . postal-code, nation.
. Province is synonym for state. (apologies to non-USA readers)
. Address-line-1 attributes include street-number, street-direction, 
. . street-name, street-name-suffix.
. Phone attributes include area-code, exchange, number, extension.

<p>
<b>Subtypes and Inheritance:</b> 
An entity may have sub-types which inherit the attributes, plans, and commands 
of their super-types. 
Often, subtypes have additional attributes of their own. 
(A subtype might also be defined 
because it adds some behavior to its super-type, 
or over-rides that behavior.)
</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<pre class="EXAMPLE">
---
Dictionary: Extensions of party.
. A person is a party.
. An organization is a party.
. A person has attributes including prefix, first-name, middle-name, 
. . last-name, suffix.
. A person's alphabetized-name is computed from the rule:
. . Smalltalk: alphabetizedName := lastName, ", ", firstName, " ", middleName.
. An organization's alphabetized-name is computed from the rule:
. . Smalltalk: alphabetizedName := name rotated.
. A worker is a person.
. A worker has a badge-number.
. An employee is a worker.
. Employee attributes include payroll-entry, benefits-entry.
. A contractor is a worker.
. Contractor attributes include vendor, contract.
. A vendor is an organization.
. A contract is a document.
</pre>

<p>
<b>Polymorphism:</b> 
In an object-oriented language, 
  a "method" of a super-type may be over-ridden by a subtype.
While Hum does not have "methods" per se, 
 it does have rules and actions that are related to specific entity types. 
A simple example of this would be how a party's name is alphabetized. 
By default, the Alphabetized Name is the same as the Name. 
But, the Person subtype will over-ride this rule. (See example above.)
</p>
<!-- ................................................................... -->
<p>
<b>Associations and Relationships:</b> 
An <i>association</i> may be regarded a a special type of entity. 
In Entity-Relationship-Analysis, 
  this concept is referred-to as an "Associative Entity". 
It is an entity because, 
in addition to the entities involved in the association, 
the association always has a time-period attribute that 
defines when the association applied to the entities involved.
For example, a marriage is an contract involving two people 
in a specific legal (and social) framework.  
The entities referenced include the person in the husband role,
the person in the wife role, a document recording the contract,
and sometimes a prenuptial agreement. 
The time-period is initialized with a start-date.
</p>
<p> A <i>time-period</i> is defined by its beginning and its ending 
(start, stop) times.
The beginning or start is known when the association is instantiated,
but the ending or stop is often not known when the association
is instantiated.
The <i>time-stamps</i> used to indicate the start and stop of an association
have an intended resolution.
In business contexts, 
the start and stop resolution is often simply a calendar date. 
However, in data operations, 
the required resolution must allow one to properly distinguish
events at the resolution of the system clock
or using an event counter.

</p>
<p class="AUTHOR"> 
	The "relationship" declaration indicted in the next box
has not been implemented (YET) in Hum.
The <b>interesting questions</b> here include:
<br/>. When do we instantiate the association? 
<br/>. In other words, what mechanism detects the event?
<br/>. . In traditional business programming,
events are implicitly detected via user interfaces.
The programmer knows that the intent of the user interface
is to observe an event,
and therefore writes logic to record the appropriate event data. 
The declaration connecting the user-interface to the event
is generally missing in traditional programming frameworks.
(As I write this, <!-- 2008.11.02 -->
it is also missing in the Hum framework.)
</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="9" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<pre class="EXAMPLE">
Relationship: Worker is assigned to Organization. (condition)
Relationship: Party is a member of Organization.  (condition)
Relationship: Party is _role_ _prep_ Party.       (condition)
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
In simple English, 
 the conditional statements in pre-conditions and post-conditions also express associations. 
The associations are instantiated when the conditions are satisfied. 
</p>
<p class="AUTHOR"> 
  The word <b>relationship</b> 
  is generally intended to mean a "binary" association
  with just two references.
  The assocative entities related to the realization of preconditions 
  are more properly <b>associations</b> in the entity-relationship sense
  because they might be trinary or n-ary associations.
</p>

<!-- ................................................................... -->

<p>
<b>Methods: </b>
In Hum, the equivalent of methods are <i>actions</i>, <i>instructions</i>, and <i>rules</i>. 
Actions connect task frames and dialog frames to action frames.
Each action statement defines a procedure containing a set of instructions.
The instructions will be carried out by an <i>actor</i> assigned to a role. 
 </p>
<p>
The actions of actors affect the <i>state</i> of the actors 
  and the state of other objects (resources).
Actors are also entities. 
And so, they are instantiated, viewed, and persisted like other entities.
</p>
<p>
<i>Rules</i> define how some attributes are derived from others. 
<p class="AUTHOR"> 
  Data derivation rules are not implemented yet. (2008.11.02)
  Nor is the syntax well-tested in the example and test ontologies.
</p>
</p>
<!-- ................................................................... -->
<p>
<b>Data Types:</b> 
In Hum the equivalent of a data type is a domain. 
The <i>domain</i> of an attribute is a <i>string</i>, 
  unless it is declared otherwise. 
The concept of a domain is that it defines constraints on the values 
  that an attribute might assume 
  and it defines operations that may be performed with those values.
It also defines conventions for displaying the value of an attribute 
  and conventions for validating data that is entered. 
For typical business processes, 
  Hum supports the following <b>domains</b>:
</p>

<ul>    
  <li>String: Any string of characters. 
      </li>
  <li>Category: A string that comes from an enumerated set. 
      <br>For example, the color of a thing might be categorized as one of: 
	  red, yellow, blue, green, orange, purple, blank, white, and so on. 
	  Or, looking at the question in reverse, 
	    one might say that "red" is a category of color.
	  </li>
  <li>Text: A string that has the semantics of natural language. 
      <br>For example, text has words, sentences, paragraphs, sections, and titles.
      </li>
  <li>Document: A text with embedded formatting advice.
      </li>
  <li>Measure: A number that is associated with a unit of measure.
      <br>The system understands the semantics of measures.
	  It knows that you cannot add centimeters to meters without conversion. 
	  It knows that when you multiply meters by meters you get square-meters. 
	  It knows that measures have an implied precision (digits of accuracy) 
	    and will not over-state the precision of a result.
	  </li>
  <li>Count: A number that is a count of some type of entity. 
      <br>The system will not add apples and oranges 
	    unless apples and oranges have a common super-type, such as fruit. 
		(In which case, the resulting count is expressed in "fruits".)
	  </li>
  <li>Probability: A number that is between zero and one. 
      <br>Probabilities are associated with events or values.
	      They are usually displayed as percentages.
      </li>
  <li>Distribution: A probability distribution.
      <br>Distributions are inputs to simulations and allocation rules.
	  <br>Distributions are outputs from simulations and actual operations. 
      </li>	  
  <li>Time: a point in time. 
      <br>A point in time may be expressed with varying levels of precision. 
	  For example: century, year, month, quarter, day, hour, minute, second, 
	  and sub-second.
	  <!--
	  In a simulation, the time at which an event occurs 
	    is given a precision based on the simulation's clock. 
	  In real-world operations, the time at which an event occurs is given
	  a precision based on the system clock (typically, millisecond precision).
	  -->
	  </li>
  <li>Time Period: a period of time has a start and a finish. 
      <br>It is often used to express the start and end of a relationship or state.
      Since some relationships and states are "in-progress" 
	  - the finish may be unknown.
	  </li>
  <li>Elapsed Time: Elapsed time is a special case of a measure.<br>
      </li>
</ul>
<p>
Hum is <i>extensible</i>. 
So programmers may add domains (data types) to the system when needed.
