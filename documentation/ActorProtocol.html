<h2>Actor Protocol</h2>
<h3>Actor Interface</h3>
<p> 
  To speak to an actor, 
    we simply send a statement 
    along with the objects that the statement references.  
  If the actor is on the web, 
    we simply send the request with an HTTP POST.
</p>
<p> 
  The message sent to the actor is a Hum 
  <a href="FrameTypes.html#DatatFrame">data frame</a> 
  and looks like this:
<pre class="example">
---
Data: Action request sent to remote actor.
Action:
. statement: Assemble coffee-drink.
. request: r756446356-33. 
. coffee-drink:
. . recipe: latte.
. . decaffeinated: Yes.
. . skim-milk: No.
---
</pre>  
<p class="ADVICE">
 In the back-plane, the message carries various data 
   that is used by the delivery system.
 For example: unique message identifier, source address, time sent, digital signature. 
 Because such data serves the back-plane, not the business process,
   we do not show that data here.
 That data is in the tranport layer, not the actor interface layer.  
</p>
<h3>Actor Address</h3>
<p>
  The actor's address on the web is a URI that looks like this:
  <br/>.
  <br/><code>http://www.server.com/.../actor/1234</code>
  <br/>.
  <br/>where "1234" in the example is the actor's local identifier. 
  The local identifier can be any string.
  We suggest anything that works well in a URI as a good-enough choice. 
</p>
<p> 
  If we need privacy or security, the simple solution is to use HTTPS.
  The protocol is otherwise unchanged.
</p>

<h3>Registration</h3>
<p> 
  The actor registers itself with a Resource Manager 
    by sending a message to a Resource Manager.
  The message is sent with an HTTP POST.
  The actor simply tells the manager its address
    and a list of the roles it can perform.
  Optionally, the actor can give its "quit time"  
    so that the resource manager will avoid assigning tasks
    which would exceed the quit time.
</p>
<p> 
  The resource manager has a URI that looks like this:
  <br/>.
  <br/><code>http://www.server.com/.../resourceManager/4321</code>
  <br/>.
  <br/>where "4321" is the resource manager's local identifier.
</p>
<p> 
The message sent to the resource manager is a Hum 
  <a href="FrameTypes.html#DatatFrame">data frame</a> 
  and looks like this:
  
<pre class="example">
---
Data: Remote actor reporting for work.
Event: 
. statement: Remote actor is available on schedule enclosed.
. Actor:
. . name: One-Arm Charlie.
. . roles: coffee-mixer, donut-fetcher.
. . address: https://www.coffeeshop314159/robot/OneArmCharlie.
. . key: www.coffeeshop314159/robot/OneArmCharlie.
. Schedule:
. . begin: now.
. . end: 2010.12.31 23:59. (Lease expires.)
---
</pre>  
</p>

<h3>Quit</h3>
<p>
  The actor can quit (de-register) at any time 
    as long as it is not currently working a request. 
  It does that by sending a message to the resource manager.
  The "quit notice" is sent in a data frame that looks like this:
<pre class="example">
---
Data: Quit notice.
Event: 
. statement: Actor will be unavailable per reason for period.
. actor: www.coffeeshop314159/robot/OneArmCharlie. 
. reason: Robot going off-line for safety inspection.
. period:
. . start: now.
. . duration: 30 minutes.
---
</pre> 

<h3>Completion Report</h3> 
<p> 
  When an actor completes an request, 
    it sends back a "completion report"
    in a data frame that looks like this:
<pre class="example">
---
Data: Work completion report.
Completion-Report.
. statement: Actor consumed resources while completing request.
. actor: www.coffeeshop314159/robot/OneArmCharlie.
. request: r756446356-33.
. resources:
. . coffee-mech: 47 seconds.
. . milk: 500 ml.
. . expresso: 1 shot.
---
</pre>    
</p>
<h3>Trouble Report</h3> 
<p> 
  When an actor cannot complete a request, 
    it sends back a "trouble report"
    in a data frame that looks like this:
<pre class="example">
---
Data: Actor cannot complete assigned request.
Event:
. statement: Actor encountered problem while working request.
. actor: www.coffeeshop314159/robot/OneArmCharlie.
. request: r756446356-33. (request that cannot be completed)
. problem:
. . category: Missing material.
. . reason: Skim milk container is empty.
. . status: Coffee-mech is waiting for material.
---
</pre>    
  The resource manager will take whatever corrective action 
    is appropriate to the situation. 
  Typically, it will refer the problem to a "trouble-shooter" actor
    which has the knowledge for coping with troubles.
  For example: The trouble-shooter actor could be a human 
    or a case-based-reasoning system.    
  In the case above, the actor is waiting for material.
  The the trouble-shooter actor could tell the human attendant to re-fill the skim milk container; or, if there is no more skim milk, the trouble-shooter could abort the current order and send a runner to get some skim milk. (In the mean time, operations will be very constrained.)
