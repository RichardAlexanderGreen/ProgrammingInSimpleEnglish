U: What is a cookie?
S: A cookie is a small file that your web browser keeps.
   Cookies are used by web sites to facilitate dialogs with users.
   The web site can store small amounts of data on the cookie
     and thus know that the user has been to the site before.
   The browser will not permit a web site to view cookies left by other web sites.
   
   The only other practical way for a web site to know who is calling
   is for the web site to ask for a user-name and password.   
. (A special purpose browser could provide identification information, but that would be of limited use.)   
...
Context: Guest.

   Sorry. I do not know what "[*]" means in this context.

Dialog: Tell me more.
U: Tell * Simple English.
U: * Simple English?
S: 
   Simple English is a new programming system based on a old idea.
   The old idea is to allow people to write programs in natural written English.
   The first attempt was the COBOL language. 
   COBOL was invented around 1960 
     and was based on the technologies available at that time.
   Simple English was invented around 2005 and, of course,
     it is based on more evolved technologies.
