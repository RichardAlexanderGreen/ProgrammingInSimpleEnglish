<h1>Ontology Graphs</h1>
  <p> 
    Graphs of an ontology provide hints about structural problems.
    In some cases, the graphing algorithm detects structural problems directly.
  </p>

<h2>Ontology for: Customer Is Moving</h2> 

  <p>
    The ontology below defines a plan for handling a "customer transfer" at an energy utility.
    The customer is moving from an old residence to a new residence.
  </p>
  
<pre class="example">

. Energy-services at old-address are re-assigned.
Actions:
. None. (The task frame serves to define a compound condition.)
---
Task: Forward old customer-accounts to customer's new-billing-address.

<h2>Plan Tree</h2>  
  <p> 
    The plan tree diagram shows the structure of the task frames.
    The arrows indicate precedence relations.
    White boxes indicate task frames by their post-conditions.
    Green boxes indicate signals which enable pre-conditions without any work being done by the agents in this plan. (The work might be done elsewhere.)
    Elipse nodes indicate the roles specified in task frame action statements.
    Blue-edge boxes down-stream from the role nodes indicate action statements
      that may be assigned to agents assigned to that role.
    Statements that are down-stream from the action statements 
      are instructions to the agent.  
  </p>
  <p> In this case, the graphing algorithm has detected a missing task frame.
    
  </p>

<h2>Data Flow</h2>
  <p> 
    The data flow diagram shows the flow of data through the task frames 
    to the agents. 
    The basic idea is that task frame statements should be sufficient
    to convey data by instantiating the nouns to the real world instances.
    Although Simple English allows information to be drawn from the context
    (example: session) in which the plan is running, relying on this feature 
    is not really a good idea. 
    It can cause mistakes much as it would in a person-to-person communication.
  </p>
  <p> 
    In this case, the graphing algorithm has detected a cycle in the plan tree.
    It actually took some time to discover the cause of the cycle that was detected.
    You cannot see it in the graph, but it turns out that the cycle is due to a relatively subtle problem with the interpreter's handling of supertypes.
  </p>
  
  
  <p> The collection of nouns that flow to the agents 
         (on the blue arrows)
         indicates the data that is required 
         to execute the plan. 
       Red nouns (if any) are part of the agent's vocabulary but do not appear 
       to be instantiated in the plan. 
         
  </p>
  <p><i>
        We need to be aware of super-types in this context.
        A domain word might be red (lacking an instantiation)
        because it is a supertype. 
        A domain word might also be red (in the current graph algorithm)
        because it is in a role-action statement that has no calls in the plan.
  </i> </p>

<h2>Word Relations</h2> 
  <p> 
    The graph of word relations shows super-type and attribute relations.
    Super-type relations are indicated by blue lines with arrow heads.
    Attribute relations are indicated by green lines with circle heads.
    Nouns with a blue font are "primatives". 
    The system has built-in knowledge of primative types.
  </p>
  
  <p> 
    <i>This algorithm still needs some work.
    The results are not correct yet.
    But this example is sufficient to indicate the intent.
    </i> 
  </p>

    <p> 
       Consider the tree starting with "transfer-work-order".
       The "transfer-work-order" entry in the ontology is contrived.
       It represents a data entry device.
       It forces the aggregation of data 
         that might otherwise be automatically derived from the nouns
         present in the plan tree
         plus their super-type and attribute relationships.
       We can generate a form that is equivalent 
         to the tree rooted at "transfer-work-order".
       See: <a href="TransferForm.html" title="Transfer Form">Transfer Form</a>.
    </p>
    <p>     
       The preceding "Data Flow" section shows the data flowing 
         from the plan's task frames
         to the agents.
       The collection of nouns that flow to the agents 
         (on the blue arrows)
         indicates the data that is required 
         to execute the plan.
