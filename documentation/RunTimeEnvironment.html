<h2>Run Time Environment</h2>

<h3>The nature of plans</h3>
<p> A <b>plan</b> is a collection of <b>task frames</b> 
that provide a solution to a <b>goal</b>. 
The goal is defined by a goal-statement that matches a post-condition in a task frame in some <b>ontology</b>. A plan is instantiated from an <b>ontology</b> that contains the needed frames
by back-chaining from the task that achieves the end-goal through all of the prerequisite tasks.<br/>
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>Plan fromOntology: o1 onGoalStatement: goalStmt.</code></p>
<p> Sometimes a plan cannot run until certain pre-conditions are satisfied.The external environment informs the plan of such conditions by invoking <code>... signalCondition: ...</code><br/>For example:<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>plan signalCondition: 'Customer is at front of order-entry-queue.'.</code></p>
<p> One checks to see if a plan is able to run by invoking
 &nbsp; <code>plan isRunnable.</code></p>
<!-- ........................................................................ -->
<h3>Helpers</h3>
<p> One runs a plan by invoking 
 &nbsp; <code>plan run.</code></p>
<p>A plan has helpers. Those helpers include:
<ul>
   <li>An <b>ontology</b> provides task frames, action frames, dictionary frames,
   view frames, and dialog frames.
   <br/>These frames define the meaning of the statements in the plan.
   The plan itself is made up of a "tree" of task frames.
   Task frames reference action frames. 
   All statements contain nouns that are defined in dictionary frames.
   The system depends on the dictionary frames to identify nouns and data types.   View frames and dialog frames define the user interface.       </li>
   <li>A <b>blackboard</b> provides the data that a plan requires.   <br/>Basically, each actor has a blackboard
   which acts as a temporary memory during the execution of a goal or action.
   A blackboard has a world-base attached.
   When a data value is needed,
    the blackboard will first query the <b>world-base</b>.
   If the world-base does not have a value, the blackboard will query the user.      </li>
   <li>A <b>world-base</b> is a temporal database attached to one or more 
   operating environments.
   </b>
   The world-base acts as the long term memory for a confideration of actors.
   The basic idea is that the confideration is acting in the context 
   of a real or imagined world.
      </li>
   <li>
   A <b>dialog actor</b> (DialogActor) may query users (clients) for needed data values.   <br/>Note: If a simulation is running, the user is a simulated entity.
   In that case, the simulated user will provide values from some distribution.   Generally, the needed data values are defined in View frames in the ontology.      </li>
   <li>A <b>resource manager</b> (ResourcePool) assigns actors to perform the instructions found in Role frames.
   <li>An <b>actor</b> may ask the blackboard for data values that it needs.
   <br/>In general, an actor is passed the values it needs to perform a request.
   However, if needed data is not passed with the request, 
   an actor can ask the requestor for needed data items.       </li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Environment</h3>
<p> A plan executes in an environment. The environment includes:
<ul>
   <li>The Goal - The plan is derived from the goal.</li>
   <li>The Resource Manager - and the resources that the resource manager controls.</li>
   <li>The Ontology - which defines the entire basis of the plan.</li>
   <li>The Speaker - which operates the channel for communication with the client-user (or a simulated user).</li>
   <li>The World State - remembers the current state of all the entities in the world including all the state of all the blackboards and work-in-process (running plans).</li>
   <li>The Bookkeeper - the bookkeeper records the durations 
       and resource usage for the plans that are run in the environment.
       (For modularity, the Bookkeeper's data-store
          is separate from the World State.)
       </li>
   <li>One or more <b>goal generators</b>.
       The real-world or virtual world connection generates goals.
       Plans are derived from the goals.
       The plans are executed in the run-time environment (a kind of work-flow engine).
       Results are recorded in the by the World State and Bookkeeper.
       </li>
</ul></p>

<h3>How are goals generated?</h3>
<p> 
Different kinds of environments generate goals in different ways.
The <b>goal generator</b> depends on the nature of the environment: simulation, real-world, or game.
</p><p> If the environment is a <b>simulation</b>, 
 the Simulator will drive the environment.<br/>The Simulator will generate goals and plans and then execute the plans in the simulated environment.The Simulator needs some specification that defines the generation of goals.
Some kind of schedule or event-generation specification is required.
A schedule could be a simple list of times and goals.
A event-generation specification could be a set of goals with the distribution of arrival times broken down by calendar days and hours.
The event-generation specification could generate a schedule.
The schedule could then be examined and re-run if needed.</p><p> It the environment is a <b>real-world environment</b>, 
  some connection to the real-world is required.<br/>For example, if the business process is operating on a web site, 
  the Speaker will need to operate the dialog frames via the web.The dialog frames may then lead to a goal which defines a plan to execute.When the plan needs user-provided data at for initialization, 
  the Speaker will ask the on-line user.When the plan completes, 
  the Speaker will inform the user (on-line or via e-mail).The Speaker resembles a web servlet in this context.The plan's run-time environment resembles a work-flow engine.(Multiple plans may be operating simultaneously 
     and plans may be long-running processes.)</p><p> If the environment is a <b>game</b>, 
  the situation  resembles a combination of real-world and simulation.<br/>The environment needs a connection to the gamers. It also needs to generate events related to the simulated world of the game.
Those events could be generated by schedulers or by "sensors" that detect the actions of the gamers in the virtual world of the game.</p><p> </p>
