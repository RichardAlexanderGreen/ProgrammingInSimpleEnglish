<h2>Security in Hum</h2>

<h3>Enterprise Security</h3>
  <p>
  	Enterprise applications need to secure access to certain features.
    A party[1] has to be authorized to request a service, control a robot, make a journal entry.
    In Hum, <i>permits</i> may be required for various actions:
    <ol>
      <li>Task level: Define who can invoke a goal in a task frame.</li>
      <li>Action level: Define who can invoke an action via a dialog.</li>
      <li>View level: Define who may view the data in the view.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p> 
    To keep things simple, if no authorization constraint is declared,
    then no authorization is required.
  </p>
  <p>[1] A party is a person, organization, or actor. 
  </p>

<h3>Authorization Annotation</h3>
  <p> 
    In the example below, 
      we use an annotation to declare the authorization required
      to perform the task: "Move customer to new-residence."
    The annotation: "[Allow call-center.]"  means that actors operating 
      with a call-center <i>permit</i> will be allowed to invoke this goal.
  </p>
  <p>Similarly, the action statement "Change to new-billing-address ..."
       has the annotation: "[Allow call-center, self-service.]"
       and that means that the action statement can be invoked
       when an actor has 
       <i>either</i> a call-center permit <i>or</i> a self-service permit.
  </p>
  <p>Finally, the annotation on the Customer-Address view 
       indicates that an actor holding any one of three permits
       is authorized to see a customer's address.
  </p>

<pre class="example">
---
Task: Move customer to new-residence. [Allow call-center.]
. . .
---
Role: Billing. 
Action: Change to new-billing-address. [Allow call-center, self-service.] 
. for all the customer's customer-accounts. 
. . . 
---
View: Customer-Address. [Allow call-center, self-service, field-operations.]
. . . 
---
</pre>

<h3>Authorization As Configuration Data</h3>
  <p>In some programming frameworks,
       the declaration of authorizations is separated 
       from the definition of the program.  
     This is done for two reasons: 
     <ol type="1">
       <li>The program may be run in more than one organization 
            and therefore the permits will vary 
            from organization to organization 
            and should not be hard-coded into the program itself. </li>
       <li>The permits can be changed without modifying the tested code. </li>
     </ol>
  </p>
  <p>Hum supports this concept and keeps things simple.
     The following example shows a data frame containing authorizations
       as configuration data. 
     One simply copies the statement requiring authorization into the data frame
       and appends the appropriate authorization annotation.
     This data frame may be one of several 
       used to configure an operating environment.    
  </p>
  
<pre class="example">
---
Data: Authorizations.
Task: Move customer to new-residence. [Allow call-center.]
Role: Billing. 
Action: Change to new-billing-address.  [Allow call-center, self-service.] 
View: Customer-Address. [Allow call-center, self-service, field-operations.]
