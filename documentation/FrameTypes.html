    <h3>Preface - This is the English version of Hum - Hum English</h3>
      <p>
       The notations shown here are for the English-language version of Hum
       which we refer to as "Hum English".
       The concepts of Hum are the same from language to language.
       But the notation may vary to accommodate the conventions
       and keyboards associated with different languages.
      </p>

<h2>Frame Notations</h2>
  <p>Hum <i>applications</i> are composed from short vignettes called
     <i>frames</i>.
     There are several types of frames which serve different purposes.
     Each type of frame uses a slightly different <i>notation</i>.
     <!--
     Other programming languages also use several notations.
     For example, COBOL has different notations in its several sections.
     FORTRAN has different notations for procedure, format, and data schema.
     Java has different notations for procedures, arrays, and properties.
     Java applications typically use several variants of XML 
     (HTML, JSP, STRUTS artifacts, EJB deployment descriptors)
     to specify display format, dialog (page flow), deployment descriptors.
     -->
  </p>
  <p>While one goal of Hum is to be as natural as possible,
     one must recognize that written English is not as "natural" as verbal English.
     Various notations and conventions are used in written English
     for various contexts and purposes.
     For example, technical documents often contain specific notations
     that have their own peculiar semantics
     and, if read aloud, would be unusable as verbal English.
     (For example: Consider a train schedule.)
     And thus, even written English contains many examples of synthetic language.
  </p>
  <p>Hum has notations that are intended to be 
       easy to learn 
       and highly readable.
     The notations are designed 
       around the concepts that they are intended to record and convey.
     Computer languages such as FORTRAN, Basic, C, and Java are designed
       as much for the computer's convenience as for human convenience.
     Hum is designed for human convenience.

<h3>Goal Frame Notation</h3>
  <p>
   The purpose of a Goal Frame is to describe part of a process.
   A component of the system called the Planner creates programs, called plan trees,
   by assembling related Goal Frames. The Planner assembles task frames to form a plan.
   It does that by working backwards from a goal.
   The goal matches a post-condition in one of the task frames.
  </p>
  <p>
   The notation of the task frame
   is designed to concisely describe
   an individual task.
   It also facilitates starting with an end-goal
   and then letting the system identify
   what process knowledge remains
   to be described.
  </p>
  <h5>Syntax</h5>  
<pre class="syntax">
---
Goal: (declarative sentence)
Preconditions:
. (pre-condition - matches some other task's post-condition)
. (pre-condition)
. (...)
. (Some tasks have no pre-conditions. They are ready to run.)
Actions:
. (role) : (action - understood by an actor assigned the role)
. (role) : (action)
. (...)
. (Some tasks will have no actions. They simply define a named-state.)
---
</pre>
<h5>Example</h5>
<pre class="example">
Goal: Order delivered to customer.
Preconditions:
. Customer has paid for order.
. Order is ready for delivery.
Actions:
. Counter: Give order package to customer.
. Bookkeeper: Account for order revenue and taxes.
</pre>
  <h4>Goal Frame Statements</h4>
  <ul>
   <li>The "Goal" statement defines the post-condition
    that will be satisfied when the task is completed.
    The post-condition of the top-most task in a plan tree
    is the <i>goal</i> of the plan.
   </li>
   <li>The "Precondition" statements define the pre-conditions (prerequisites)
    that must be met before work on the "Actions" can begin.
    Some task frames have no pre-conditions
    which means that the work can begin immediately.
    <br />- The Planner forms a plan tree by
    back-chaining pre-conditions in each frame
    to post-conditions in other frames
    until all the pre-conditions are matched.
   </li>
   <li>The "Actions" specify the work needed to satisfy the post-condition
    once the pre-conditions have been satisfied.
    Some task frames have no actions.
    Such frames serve to combine two or more conditions
    into a single condition.
   </li>
  </ul>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->  
<hr>  
  
  <a name="RoleFrame"></a>
  <h3>Role Frame Notation</h3>
  <p>
   Role Frames provide the <i>instructions</i>
   required to perform a <i>action</i>.
   At run-time, these instructions will be executed
   by an <i>actor</i> assigned the <i>role</i>
   named in the step.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since the instructions are written in Hum,
   they can be understood equally well by humans, robots, and sim-bots.
   When we run the actual business,
   the instructions are executed by humans and/or robots.
   When we simulate the operation of the business,
   the instructions are performed by <i>sim-bots</i>.
   The same system can be used to operate the business in the real world
   or in a virtual world.
   In fact,
   we may want to test our processes in the virtual world
   before running them in the real-world.
  </p>

<pre class="syntax">

Role: (role)                                     << Actors are assigned roles
Action: (action invoked in a task frame step)    << Goal Frames invoke actions.

  <a name="DictionaryFrame"></a>
  <h3>Dictionary Frame Notation</h3>
  <p>
   The purpose of a Dictionary Frame is to describe the <i>vocabulary</i> of the task world.
   Dictionary items map new concepts to concepts
   that the Hum system already knows.
   The Hum system already understands terms such as:
   order, order item,
   bill-of-material, material, part, assembly, container,
   person, worker, employee, organization, roles,
   measure, metric, money, cost, price, account,
   resource, resource pool, inventory,
   and more.
  </p>
  <p>
   The design of the dictionary notation
   is meant to allow people to describe terms
   in a natural style.
   The style is close to written English in this case.
  </p>
  <p>Syntax:</p>
<pre class="syntax">
---
Dictionary:
A (name) is a (name).
("a" and "an" are interchangeable.)
(name = noun phrase)
A (name) attributes include (name), (name), (name), (name), and (name).
---
</pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="example">
---
Dictionary: Coffee-Mech Facts.
. A coffee-mech is a robot.
. A coffee-mech attributes include make, model, and software-release.
. JavaBot is a synonym for coffee-mech.
. SN is shorthand for serial-number.
---
Dictionary: Employee Relationships.
. A mentor is an employee.
. An employee is a worker.    (Some workers are employees.)
. A contractor is a worker.   (Some workers are contractors.)
. A worker is a person.
. A supervisor is an employee.
---
</pre>
  <h4>Dictionary Frame Statements</h4>
  <ul>
   <li>The "... is a ..." statement enables you
    to define a word in terms of another word that the system already knows.
    The nouns in an "is a" statement defines a term as referring 
    to an entity-type (class) that is a subtype (sub-class) of a known entity-type.
   </li>
   <li>The "... attributes include ..." statement identifies 
           the <i>attributes</i> of an <i>entity.</i>
   </li>
   <li>
       The "... is a synonym for ..." statement
       advises the system that the two terms might be used interchangeably.
   </li>
   <li>The "... is shorthand for ..." statement
       advises the system that a term may be used as a shorthand
       when entering new statements or data into the system.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Acronyms, Synonyms, and Shorthand.</h4> 
  <p>
     The dictionary accommodates acronyms with the phase:
     "... is shorthand for ..."
     Synonyms are recorded with the phrase:
     "... is a synonym for ..."
  </p> 
<pre class="example">
---
Dictionary:
. QOH is shorthand for quantity-on-hand.
. Client is synonym for customer.
---
</pre>  
  <p><i>Shorthand</i> 
     allows the programmer to substitute a short term for a longer one
     at the time that a statement is entered. 
     The system immediately replaces the shorthand token with the full term.
     <br /><i>"Smart edit" tools are expected to implement this feature.</i>
  </p>
  <p><i>Synonyms</i> are used to indicate a word or phrase 
  			that can be mapped to another word or phrase 
  			which is already known to the system.
     When the system interprets statements, 
       it will use synonyms to match a statement to similar statements.
     Synonyms allow a statements to assume two or more <i>alternate forms</i>.

  </p>
  <p class="ADVICE">     
     Do not declare a synonym when you should declare a <i>subtype</i>. 
  </p>
  <p>Synonyms may be used where they conform to normal usage in the parlance
     of the industry or shop.
     Unlike a shorthand, a synonym is not replaced on input.
     The statement is stored in the frame base with the synonym intact.
     Thus, you can use synonyms 
       when they make statements and instructions more human-readable.
  </p>

  <h4>Categories and Enumerations</h4>
  <p>
     Enumerations are sets of values that describe a kind of attribute.
     For example: Colors are given names. 
     The set of names that might describe a color constitute an enumeration. 
  </p>  
<pre class="example">
---
Dictionary:
A car may be described by its body color.
Color categories include red, green, blue, yellow, orange, brown, 
. black, white, grey, purple, mauve, maroon, tan, pink, 
. (colors that reference something else ...)
. silver, gold, copper, bronze, ivory, ebony, cobalt, cyan, taupe, charcoal,
. lavender, lilac, rose, maize, indigo, magenta, chartreuse, 
. cranberry, raspberry, burgundy, apricot, peach, cream, 
. navy blue (which navy?), royal purple (which royalty?), 
. sky blue, forest green.

<a name="ViewFrame"></a>
<h3>View Frame Notation</h3>
  <p>
      One purpose of a view frame is to indicate 
        how a business entity (entity) is displayed.
      A business entity is an object instance that appears in the problem domain.
      It typically will have several attributes of different types.
   </p>
   <p>View frames represent "forms" (fill-in the blank forms).
      They are intended for text-mode displays.
      They can be rendered as forms in almost any run-time environment
      including web-pages, applets, MS-Windows, X-Windows, Java applications, et cetera.  
   </p>
   <p>
     A view frame may be used for display or for input or for both.
     A view invoked by "Ask view-name." will update data.
     A view invoked by "Show view-name." will only display data.    
   </p>
<pre class="syntax">
---
View: (entity name)
 label: [attribute name]                              &lt;&lt; text field 
 (1) choice one  (2) choice two  (3) choice three     &lt;&lt; radio buttons
 . (1) attribute = value1                             &lt;&lt; attribute set to value
 . (2) attribute = value2
 . (3) attribute = value3
 
 [1] pepperoni  [2] sausage  [3] green pepper         &lt;&lt; check boxes
 . [1] attribute1 [2] attribute2 [3] attribute3       &lt;&lt; elements set true/false
 
 crust: [crust]                           &lt;&lt; combo box because crust is a category
 
 description: [text-attribute 5]          &lt;&lt; multi-line (text area) box of 5 lines
 
  [[ Place Order ]] Send my order to the kitchen.
. [[ Place Order ]] Deliver [pizza] order.            &lt;&lt; Button sets goal.  
---
</pre>
   <h4>View Frame Statements</h4>
   There are two types of lines in a view frame.
   <ol>
    <li><i>Mark-up lines</i> indicate what will be displayed.
     Hum`s mark-up notation is meant to be nearly WYSIWYG.
    </li>
    <li><i>Button instructions</i>, which begin with a dot,
           specify the action to take for a radio/checkbox/or action button.
    </li>
   </ol>
   View frames indicate data-control widgets with bracket notations:
   <ul>
    <li><code>[name]</code> binds to an attribute of the entity (given after "View:").
     <br />The substring "[name]" will be replaced by a form slot (text box).
     <br />The value is provided by the context or left blank for the user to fill in.
     <br />Use <code>[entity attribute]</code> to resolve ambiguity. 
    </li>
    <li><code>[name 9]</code> indicates a multi-line text box.
     <br />The name refers to an attribute that is expected to have a text value.
     <br />The number following "..." indicates
     the number of lines to display in the text box.
    </li>
    <li><code>[1]</code> indicates a check box.
     <br />The associated boolean attribute is indicated in the button instruction
           that follows the template line.
    </li>
    <li><code>(1)</code> indicates a radio button.
     <br />The attribute and value associated with the radio button is indicated
     by one of the button instructions that follow the mark-up line.
    </li>
    <li><code>[[ Button Label ]]</code> indicates a push-button.
      <br />The button is mapped to a goal with a button instruction:
      <br /><code>. [[ Button Label ]] Goal-statement. </code>
    </li>
	<li><code>[pane: view-name]</code> causes another pane to be nested 
	    within the current pane. The other pane is defined in its own view frame.
	</li>
	<li><code>[link: text | URI ]</code> indicates a hyperlink with the given text and URI.
	</li>
	<li><code>[link: text ]</code> indicates a hyperlink to a local page with the given text. 
	    The URI is derived from the text to point to a local page. 
	    (This is how many wiki links work.)
	</li>
   </ul>
<!--
   <p class="AUTHOR">
       The current design does not fully anticipate voice input.
       The view frames could be adapted to that use.
       However, some serious thought is needed, 
         because in that mode,
         the view frames will interact strongly with dialog frames 
         -- the panel and dialog frames becoming closely coupled.
       In that kind of environment,
         the view frames might be designed to guide the <a href="Scribe.html">Scribe</a>
         which is running a series of prompts.
         The view frames might indicate optimum order.

       View frames represent "forms". 
       Forms are ubiquitous in our culture with strong conventions. 
       Forms provide a traditional way to structure a communication
         when several data elements are required
         or when there are several choices.
       People who routinely communicate in writing find them convenient.  
       <br />-
       An avatar that helps a user fill-in a form panel

<h3>Dialog Frame Notation</h3>
   <p>
    The purpose of a Dialog Frame is to describe a dialog between the user and the system.
    In the notation, a line starting with "U:" is something the user might say.
    A line starting with "S:" is the system's dialog response.
    A line starting with a dot "." is the system's <i>action</i>.
    This notation is the Hum equivalent of the
    Artificial Intelligence Markup Language
     (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIML" title="AIML">AIML</a>)
    XML notation for natural language software actors.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the Hum system, some dialogs are automatically constructed by the system.
    For example: When given a user goal,
    the Planner will construct a plan tree from task frames by back-chaining.
    When the plan tree is complete,
    the Planner will then determine what data is required to articulate the plan.
    Some data may be in the world memory and some may be needed from the user.
    The system's user interface actor will ask the user for needed data
    using whatever medium is available.
    If we are in contact with the user via a browser or IM-client, 
       an interactive dialog will be conducted by the Planner`s <a href="Scribe.html">Scribe</a>.
   </p>
<h5>Example</h5>
<pre  class="example">
---
Dialog: User enters site.

U: Knock. (User appears at entry.)
S: Hello. What can I do for you?
. Show 'Activities'.

U: I would like to [act]. (Browse Catalog, Check Order Status, Cancel Order, Open Account)
S: An excellent choice! 
. Show [act].
. Switch context to [act].
---
Dialog: User browses product catalog. 
Context: Browse Catalog
U: I want * [product category].
U: Show me * [product category].
U: Do you have * [product category]?
S: Here are the different kinds of [product category].
. Show [product category].    (Show view that matches the product category.)
. Add [product category] to context.
---
Dialog: User is looking at specific product category.
Context: Media
U: Show me * by [artist].
S: Let us see if we have anything indexed that way.
. Show [product category] items by [artist].
. (If there are none, the "Show" format will say so.)
---
U: I want to buy [item name].
U: I want to buy [item code].
S: [item name] is now in your shopping cart. 
   You may remove it later if you change your mind.
. Put [item] in shopping-cart.   
---
</pre>
   <p class="AUTHOR"> 
      Think more carefully about how [entity] (see above "[item]") in dialog 
        is related to a noun in an action statement or goal statement.
   </p>
<h4>Dialog Frame statements</h4>
   <p>
    Dialog frames require a full chapter to explain them.
    For a overview, read this decomposition of the example above:
    <ul>
     <li>Dialog Frames start with a dialog statement ("Dialog: ...").
      <br />- The sentence following the colon indicates the nature of the dialog.
     </li>
     <li>A  context statement ("Context: ...") indicates when the pattern
      that follows it will be applicable.
      <br />- Just as humans need context
      to understand the intent of a verbal statement,
      the <a href="Scribe.html">Scribe</a> also needs some context.
      If the same pattern appears in two different contexts,
      the <a href="Scribe.html">Scribe</a> will attempt to disambiguate the situation
      by applying the contexts that are most current.
      <ul>
       <li>When the system attempts to recognize the user's intent,
        it attempts to match patterns in each context
        according to the <i>priority</i> of the context.
       </li>
       <li>
        It attempts the context with the highest priority first.
        If no match is found in that context,
        the next highest context is applied
        until a match is found.
       </li>
       <li>If no match is found anywhere,
        the <a href="Scribe.html">Scribe</a> will tell the user 
        that it does not understand
        what they have said
        and suggest that the user try to say it in another way.
       </li>
       <li>In a more advanced implementation,
        the <a href="Scribe.html">Scribe</a> may ask questions to disambiguate
        the user's intent.
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>A line starting with "U:" indicates the user's speech act.
         <br />- The speech act may be provided by direct input
         (the user actually typed a sentence of the given form or spoke the words)
         or as a result of interpreting a form that the user has filled in.
         <ul>
             <li>The "star" (*) notations
                 <br />in the pattern lines indicate
                 some arbitrary string of words that might be there, or might not.
             </li>
             <li>The [name] notations
                 <br /> in the pattern lines indicate a term that is defined in a
                 <a href="#DictionaryFrame"> Dictionary Frame</a>.
                 The [name] notation will match any string of words
                 that refer to an entity
                 of the indicated <i>type</i> or <i>super-type</i>.
             </li>
         </ul>
     </li>
     <li>One or more lines beginning with "U:" form a <i>pattern</i>
         to be recognized by dialog system.
         <br />- When the pattern is recognized,
         the system responds by interpreting the lines following "S:"
         (the remainder of the dialog <i>vignette</i>).
      <ul>
         <li>The response will often contain a mix of dialog lines
             which are displayed or spoken to the user,
             and <i>instructions</i>,
             which set <i>goals</i> to be fulfilled by the system
             or <i>actions</i> to be performed by <i>roles</i> 
             	(actors available to the system).
             Most instructions are directed to the dialog actor (the <a href="Scribe.html">Scribe</a>).
             For example, in the dialog frame above, 
               the "<code>. Show ...</code>" instructions 
               are directed to the <a href="Scribe.html">Scribe</a>.
         </li>
         <li>Each goal will match the name of a task that is defined in a
             <a href="#GoalFrame"> Goal Frame</a>.
             In the example above, several tasks are invoked.
             The corresponding task frames
             will contain actions assigned to the human interface actor:
             <ul>
                <li>"Show ... "
                    - will display the entity or form
                      that matches the remainder of the sentence.
                </li>
                <li>"Switch context to ..."
                    - will change the dialog context.
                    Future input from the user will be recognized
                    and interpreted in the given context.
                    (In a more advanced system, multiple contexts are permitted
                    but the indicated context is given <i>priority.</i>
                </li>
                <li>"Add ... to context."
                    - adds the term (in ...) to the context.
                    Prior terms in the context remain in effect also.
                </li>
             </ul>
         </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ul>
   </p>

<h4>Dialog Example - "Hello World"</h4>   
<p style="page-break-after:avoid;">
Here is the proverbial "Hello World" example:
</p>   
<pre class="example">
---
Dialog: Hello world example.
U: Knock knock. (User appears at our entry.)
S: Who's there?
. Set context to "first name".
---
Context: first name.
U: *
S: * who? 
. Set context to "last name".
. Assert: User's first name is *.
---
Context: last name.
U: *
S: Hello, [firstName] *.
. Assert: User's last-name is *.
</pre>
<p > 
  In the example above, the "Assert:" instructions go to the "Assert" actor.
  Other instructions go to the <a href="Scribe.html">Scribe</a> by default because no role is indicated.
  Roles are indicated by the instruction syntax 
  <br />"<code>. (role): ...</code>" 
     - with a role-name and a colon preceding the statement.
  <br />This is the same syntax that we use in task frames and role frames
    to indicate what role is performing an instruction.

<h3>Data Frame Notation</h3>
   <p>
    Data frames are used to communicate data.
    They are used 
     in message payloads between actors and resource managers,
     and to record configuration data. 
    Hum authors (programmers)
     will rarely need to write data frames 
     but may want to read them.
   </p>
<h5>Syntax / Example</h5>   
<pre class="syntax">
---
Data: (data set name)     &lt;&lt; Indicate a data frame. Give the frame a name/title.

Worker                    &lt;&lt; The following data is for a worker (entity). 
. ID: (string)            &lt;&lt; The system knows an ID should be unique.
. name: (string)          &lt;&lt; provides the data value for worker's "name" attribute.
. Home Address            &lt;&lt; "Home Address" is an embedded entity.
. . line1: (string)
. . line2: (string)
. . postal code: (string) &lt;&lt; "Reader" and "Smart Editor" validate values.
. age: (string)           &lt;&lt; This value should be a positive integer.

Site                      &lt;&lt; The following data is for a Site (entity)
. name: (string)          &lt;&lt; name of site

. description:            &lt;&lt; The description of the site is in text format.
"""                       &lt;&lt; Arbitrary text delimited by triples as shown here.
(text)                    &lt;&lt; The text data starts on the line after the triple.
"""                       &lt;&lt; A triple (""") or (''') starts and ends the text.

. Site Address            &lt;&lt; "Site Address" is an embedded entity.
. . line1: (string)
. . postal code: (string)
---
</pre>

<h4>Data Frame Statements</h4>
   <p>
    The comments in the example above follow the " &lt;&lt;" marker.
    The comments indicate how the data frame notation works.
   </p>
   <p>
    In this example, we have a Worker entity and a Site entity.
    The Worker has four attributes: ID, name, Home Address, and age.
    The Home Address attribute is another entity embedded in the Worker entity data.
    The indentation indicates that the Home Address belongs to the Worker.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Site entity has three attributes: name, description, and Site Address.
    The value of the description attribute
     contains multiple lines of text between lines
      that start with the triple quote (""" or ''').
    You can put any text between the triple quotes except for another line that
    starts the same way. (That would confuse the data reader.)
   </p>
<h4>Tables</h4>
   <p>
    Within a Data Frame, an attribute might contain a table.
    This is appropriate when the attribute is a collection
    of "child" entities and the child entities have a "flat" structure.
    For example, a worker's weekly schedule might look like this:
   </p>
<h5>Example</h5>
<pre class="example">
---
Data: Worker's Scheduled Hours

Worker
. ID: 12345
. name: Robin Good
. weekly hours:
"""
table of weekly-hours delimited by |
| Day       | Begin | End  | 
| Monday    | 0600  | 1400 |
| Tuesday   | 0600  | 1400 |
| Wednesday | 0600  | 1400 |
| Thursday  | 0600  | 1400 |
| Friday    | 0600  | 1400 |
"""
---
</pre>
<h5>Table Syntax</h5>
   <p>
    A table is multi-line text enclosed in triple quotes.
    The table text follows a special notation.
    <ul>
     <li>The first line will start with the phrase: 
          "table of (entity) delimited by x".
      <br />A "pipe" (|) is often a good choice for a delimiter
      because it makes the table quite readable.
      However a comma may be more convenient for some typists.
	  A pipe (|) is the default delimiter.
     </li>
     <li>The rows and columns of the table will start and end
      with the indicated delimiter.
      In the example, we have added spaces to make the delimiters line up.
      But that was done only to make the example more readable
      and is not necessary.
     </li>
     <li>The first row identifies the attributes contained in the columns.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </p>

  Think about how to represent relationships.
