<h1>Resource Manager  </h1>
  <p>The run-time Resource Manager assigns tasks (actions) to <a href="Actor.html">Actors</a>.
     An actor <i>advertises</i> the roles it can perform 
     when it "checks-in" with the Resource Manager.
     When a running job invokes an action statement, 
       the Resource Manager finds an available actor that can perform the 
		<a href="Role.html">role</a>.
     </p>
<h3>Single Threaded</h3>
	  <p>Actors are assumed to be single-threaded and will only be assigned to one task at a time. 
	The Resource Manager tracks which actors are busy versus which are available.
     </p>
