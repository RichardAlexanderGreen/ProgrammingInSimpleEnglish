<h2>Running the Business</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  The purpose of this section is to explain how the Hum framework works.
  In simplest terms, the system forms a plan to meet each goal it is given,
    and then executes the plan.
</p>
<p>	
  In this section we will explain the normal case 
  - where there are no planning errors
    and no exceptions. 
  In another section, 
    <a href="FindingTheMissingLink.html">"Finding the Missing Link"</a>,	
    we will explain how the system detects plans that are incomplete or inconsistent.
  And later, 
    in <a href="TroubleShooting.html">"Trouble Shooting"</a>,
	we will explain how the system detects and handles problems (exceptions)
	that might occur during the execution of a plan.	
</p>

<h3>Back-Chaining to Form a Plan Tree.</h3>
<p>
  The <a href="DonutShopV01Linked.html">Donut Shop Version 0.1 Listing</a>
  shows how a business process is defined in a top-down fashion.
  At execution time, the system is given a goal.
  The system matches the goal to the post-condition of some task frame.
  It then forms a <i>plan-tree</i> 
    by <a href="BackChaining.html">back-chaining</a>
    through task frames whose post-conditions match the pre-conditions
    of higher-level task frames.
  The plan-tree is a tree-graph whose nodes are task frames.	
</p>
<p>
   Since many business processes may share the same sub-processes,
     the task frames are kept in a shared store that we call the <i>plan base</i>.
   Many plan-trees could be derived from the same plan base.
</p>
<p>   	 
   Because the plan base could be upgraded while a plan-tree is in-progress,
     the plan-tree that is associated with a goal
	 is stored with all of the other data associated with the goal 
	 and the original plan remains in-effect until the goal is met. 
   The system will not unilaterally change a plan that is in progress.
   However, it does provide features that can facilitate such changes.	 
</p>

<h3>Executing the Plan</h3>
<p>
  Any task frame in the plan tree whose pre-conditions are satisfied can be executed.
  The system executes all such nodes in parallel.
  As each task frame is completed, 
    its post-condition is satisfied
	and this may enable other task-frames to be executed.
  This process continues until the top-most task frame is executed.
  When the top-most task frame is executed, its post-condition is satisfied.
  Since that post-condition matches the goal 
    that the system was given at the start of the process,
    the system has met the goal.
</p>

<h3>What's a Sim-Bot To Do?</h3>
<p>
  The Coordinator executes each action
    by assigning an actor that knows how to perform the action.
  The Coordinator sends the action to that actor.
  If the system is operating in real-life, 
	the actors might be human beings
	and humans are quite adept at interpreting poorly formed 
	or ambiguous instructions.
  The human will figure out the missing bits from the context
	and by reasoning from experience.
  However, if the actor is to be a robot or a sim-bot,
    the instructions must be quite detailed
	and any needed data must be provided to the robot or sim-bot.
</p>
<p>
  So, what's a simple sim-bot to do? 
  Recall that the sim-bot's job is 
    to simulate an action occurring in a business process.
  Thus, the sim-bot must be able to account for time-spent and resources-consumed.
  To check for delays, the sim-bot must account 
    for the time it spends waiting for a resource to become available.
</p>
<p>
  Now we know what the sim-bot needs to know.
  It needs to know about the duration of the action that it is performing.
  It also needs to know about the resources that the action affects.
  One resource that the action consumes is the actor's time.
  Actions may also affect other resources.
</p>
<p class="AUTHOR">Does the preceding describe a plausible deduction? 
</p>
<p>
  In our donut shop scenario, 
    the role called Coffee-Mixer is making a product. 
  The product is a coffee-drink.
  The bill-of-materials (the recipe) indicates
    certain quantities and types of coffee, milk, and flavors.
  Since the process of making the coffee-drink is irreversible,
	the materials used in the process are said to be <i>consumed.</i>
  We also cannot get the Coffee-Mixer's time back,
    so that resource is also consumed.	
</p>
<p>
  On the other hand, 
    the process of moving a donut around
	could, in theory, be reversed.
  So, the accounting for a donut involves
    moving it from one location (inventory) to another
	until it is delivered to the customer.	
</p>

<h3>Resources - Allocating, Assigning, Using</h3>
<h4>Allocating Resources</h4>
<p>
  The resources that a process consumes
    must be in the right place at the right time.
  So an important part of operating a business
    is assuring that a sufficient quantity of resource
	will be where its needed when its needed.
  And finally, when the resource is used, we need to account for it.
</p>
<p>
  In a typical business operation,
     resources are allocated in advance,
	 assigned to specific jobs (work orders),
	 and the utilization is charged to the job
	 (or product).
  If sufficient resources are not allocated,
    the business process which requires the resource will halt.
  We can prevent this in a simulation 
    by assuming that there is a sufficient supply
    of each resource when needed.
  Then we can run the simulation
    and see what resources were needed under the circumstances 
	assumed for the simulation.
</p>
<p>	
  If we have some uncertainty about future demands,
    we can run the simulation under a variety of scenarios
	and see what resources were required in each.
  That will give us some idea 
    about how to define flexible rules for allocating the resources.	
  In real life, this means defining rules about 
    when we order more materials
    and how we schedule our workers and equipment.
</p>
<h4>Assigning Resources</h4>
<p>
  The actors (<i>actors</i>) who perform actions in our business process
    may come from a pool of actors (a <i>resource pool</i>) 
	who can perform that <i>role</i> in the process.
  For example, you may have a person who is trained to perform all of the roles.  
  But, that person could also come from a pool of one.
  That means that when that person is performing one action,
    they cannot be simultaneously performing other actions.
  They are <i>assigned</i> to that action until the action is completed.
</p>
<p>
  The system keeps track of the pools and the resources in each pool.
  This puts a constraint on how much work can be done simultaneously
    and helps to simulate real-life constraints.
  The system will also track how many resources were in use at each point in time
    during a simulation.
  This information can be used to allocate appropriate resources 
    when running the actual business.		
</p>

<h4>Using Resources - Job Accounting</h4>
<p>
  In some business situations, the resources that are expended on each job 
    (each order, each contract)
    must be detailed on the invoice.
  In other situations, we are only concerned with the totals.
  In the Hum framework, 
    we provide time and cost accounting at several levels of two dimensions:
	task hierarchy dimension, resource hierarchy dimension.
</p>
<p>
  The business process can provide for any additional accounting
    that their business requires
    by defining steps for the Book-Keeper role.
  For example, additional product or product-line accounting could easily
    be added by associating products (and thus, product lines)
	with each order item.	
</p>

<h3>Financial Accounting - Costs, Assets, Activities</h3>
<p>
  The system accounts for resources used.
  To get direct costs, 
    one associates internal prices (cost per unit used)
    with each resource.
  The system will do the needed multiplications and sums.	
</p>
<p>
  The actors in the business process 
    are typically assigned from resource pools.
  The direct costs of an action can be calculated 
    by associating an internal price 
    (a kind of rental rate) with each resource type or role.
  The indirect costs associated with a pool
	can be calculated by associating some rental rate or carrying cost
	with unassigned resources.
  In addition, one could set a fixed cost per period 
    to account for the cost of managing the pool.	
</p>
<p>
  Additional indirect costs can be associated with material inventories.
  Carrying-cost percentages can be associated with each inventory
    and used to calculate various financial numbers.
</p>
<p class="ADVICE"> 
The system provides time and cost accounting on the <i>task hierarchy</i>:
<br />- Enterprise: Cost for the business unit.
<br />- Goal: The top-most task in a plan. 
<br />- Task: The task-name of a task frame.
<br />- Action: An action statement in a task frame. (Assigned to a role.)
<br />- Step: A step within an action definition. (Assigned to actor.)
<br />...
<br />The system also tracks resource utilization, including:
<br />- Utilization of <i>rentable</i> resources. (actors, plant, and equipment)
<br />- Draws on <i>parts</i> inventories (disbursed in integer counts)
<br />- Draws on <i>materials</i> inventories (disbursed in real-number measurements)
<br />...
<br />Resource utilization is summed up the task hierarchy.
<br />In addition, it is summed on the <i>resource hierarchy</i>:
<br />- Enterprise: Utilization across the business unit.   
<br />- Resource Pool: a resource pool (inventory location, group of people) 
<br />- Resource Type: a type of resource (part number, material type, role)
<br />- Resource Instance: utilization of a specific rentable thing 
<br />...
<br />Note: Pools may contain pools forming a hierarchy of pools.
</p>

<h3>Short-Term and Long-Term Memory</h3>
<p>
  <b>Short-Term:</b> 
  The system needs to keep track 
    of what is happening during the execution of a plan.
  In the Donut Shop example, plans probably run to completion 
    with durations on the order of 20 to 200 seconds. 
  But in other business situations it may takes many weeks to complete a goal. 
  Thus, the system needs to keep track of the progress of a plan
    and all of the accounting associated with a goal
	for an indefinite amount of time.
  Thus, "short term" is a relative concept.
  It refers to the records associated with the execution of a plan.		
</p>
<p>
  <b>Now:</b>
  The system needs to keep track of the current state of the enterprise continuously.
  It needs to track how many resources are in each resource pool
    and of the state of each pool and each resource.
  Various resource accounts are also accumulating and need to be maintained.	
</p>
<p>
  <b>History:</b>
  There are rules and regulations applied to an enterprise 
    that define how long various types of records are kept.
  In the Hum framework, 
    every record is kept until it is explicitly purged.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Statistics:</b>
  Simple statistics such as the mean and standard deviation of a number
     are often misleading or useless in business analysis.
  One is better informed by the entire distribution curve (or histogram).
  Since the system maintains detailed records of all events,
    it is possible to develop any statistical measure one needs after the fact.
  However, it may be more useful to have the statistical measures
    available in <i>real-time</i>.  	
</p>
<p> 
  <b>Instrumentation:</b>
  Real-time instrumentation enables statistical measures 
     to be monitored
	 while the business is operating, 
     or while a simulation of the business is operating.
  One enables statistic measures 
     by informing the "Statistician" that certain bookkeeping measures
     and ratios of bookkeeping measures are business metrics.
  The <i>Statistician</i> is an extension of the <i>Bookkeeper</i>.
