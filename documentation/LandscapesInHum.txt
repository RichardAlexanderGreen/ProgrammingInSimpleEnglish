Comment: Landscapes in Hum.

. Experiment: Use Hum action language to produce architecture.

. Conjecture: The “Builder” role might be implemented Croquet.
===
Role: Builder.

Action: Layout 4 bedroom house.
. Create a room 7 wide 4 long giving dining-room.
. Create a room 1 wide 12 long giving aisle.
. Center aisle on North side of dining-room.
. Create a room 3 wide 2 long giving galley.
. Position galley North of dining-room, West of aisle.
. Create a room 3 wide 2 long giving stairwell.
. Position stairwell North of dining-room, East of aisle.

. Create a room 3 wide 3 long giving SW-bedroom.
. Position SW-bedroom North of galley, West of aisle.
. Create a closet 3 wide 1 long giving SW-closet.
. Position closet North of SW-bedroom, West of aisle.
. Create a bathroom 3 wide 2 long giving SW-bath.
. Position SW-bath North of SW-closet, West of aisle.

. (Repeat above for each bedroom - but put bathrooms back to back for plumbing convenience.)

Comment: Action language is flexible but slightly verbose.
. This is a flexible language that can express almost any idea. 
. But it is slightly verbose.
. The following demonstrates a mark-up notation that is not as flexible, but less verbose.
===
Layout: 4 bedroom house. 

(convention is that layout maps North-to-South into top-to-bottom and West-to-East into left-to-right)

[North-porch: 7 by 3]
[North-room: 7 by 4]

[NW-bedroom: 3 by 3] [aisle: 1 by 12] [NE-bedroom: 3 by 3] 
[NW-closet: 3 by 1]  [aisle] [NE-closet: 3 by 1]
[NW-bath: 3 by 2]    [aisle] [NE-bath: 3 by 2]
[SW-bath: 3 by 2]    [aisle] [SE-bath: 3 by 2]
[SW-closet: 3 by 1]  [aisle] [SE-closet: 3 by 1]
[SW-bedroom: 3 by 3] [aisle] [SE-bedroom: 3 by 3]

[galley: 3 by 2]     [entry: 1 by 2] [stairwell: 3 by 2] 

[dining-room: 7 by 4]
[South-porch: 7 by 3]

(Following actions are directed to Builder role.)
. Place skylight over aisle.
. Place windows on external walls.
. Remove windows from closets.
. Remove windows from stairwell. 
. Place hatch over stairwell.
(Entry is extends aisle; but it has no skylight because to avoid complicating stair exit.)


(This notation only works well for rectilinear case where corners tend to line up nicely.)
(Nevertheless, it should work for a large number of simple layouts.)
(Imagine an interpreter that makes semi-smart decisions based on keywords such as ‘bath’ ‘closet’ ‘stair’ ‘bedroom’ ‘porch’ ‘hall’ ‘aisle’.)

(House is 3+4+14+4+3 = 28 meters by 7 meters (roughly 93’ by 24’) - or using 4’ units ==> 112’ by 28’)
===
Layout: Typical closet wall. 
. (Closet layout includes door to bath, desk, clothing hanging, dresser, bathroom storage.)
. (This is layout for SW-closet.)


[desk: 1 by 1][aisle-to-bath: 1 by 1] [bath-storage: 1 by 0.5]
[desk]        [aisle-to-bath]         [bedroom-storage: 1 by 0.5]

. (Place desk on outside to use natural light.)
. (Note: Bath tub also goes on outside, so that side of closet-wall is not accessible from bath side.)
===
Layout: Typical bedroom-storage. 

[tall-hanging: 0.5 by 0.5 ][dresser: 0.5 by 0.5 by 1.0; short-hanging: height 1.0 ] 
. (Convention is to stack elements bottom-up with a semi-colon to separate them. [ <bottom-element> ; <stacked-element>] )
===
Layout: Typical bedroom.
. (Bedroom has sofa that converts to bed and two side tables.)
. (This is layout for SW-bedroom.)

[North-walkway: 3 by 1]
[West-walkway: 0.7 by 1.5]    [bed-space: 1.6 by 2] [East-walkway: 0.7 by 1.5]
[West-side-table: 0.7 by 0.5] [bed-space]           [East-side-table: 0.7 by 0.5]
===
Layout: Typical bath.
. (This is layout for SE-bath.)

[tub: 1 by 2][space: 1.5 by 2] [WC: 0.5 by 0.8]
[tub]        [space]           [sink: 0.5 by 1.2]

. (Tub is on aisle-side wall. This puts weight close to center of buoyancy.)
. (WC is on outside wall. This enables sewer-lines to run in amas.)
