<h1>Task Exceptions in Hum</h1>

<p>
  Run-time exceptions in Hum are task exceptions, not program exceptions.
These occur when the run-time system detects a situation 
which indicates that a goal cannot be met under current conditions.
At the very least, work is stalled in some area of the plan
and the plan is in danger of being substantially delayed.
These situations occur due to problems in the real-world, 
not due to problems in the application program.
</p>
<p>
The system can detect exceptional situations,
but human intervention will be required
to correct or mitigate each situation.
When an exception occurs, an alarm is set, and the business operators are informed.
The nature of such exceptions is best understood by examining how a task is executed.
</p>

<p>
  <b>A plan is built by recursively adding sub-plans 
     until the leaves of the plan tree are all runnable.</b>
  <br />If the plan base is incomplete, 
        there may be some pre-conditions with no matching post-conditions.
  <br /><b>Prevention </b>: The system should not be allowed to operate with an incomplete plan base.
</p>


<p>
  <b>The task is enabled when its pre-conditions are met.</b>
  <br />If no task in the plan is currently enabled, something has gone wrong.
  A task is "pending" before its pre-conditions are met.
  Other tasks should be running (enabled) to help meet these pre-conditions.
  As each task completes, its post-condition is true.
  This may or may not enable other tasks, depending on their pre-conditions.
  However, the whole nature of the plan is that it covers all pre-conditions.
  <br /><b>Detection</b>: A pending task has no tasks running below it.
  <br /><i>This exception should only occur when the plan is invalid.</i> 
           This situation cannot occur when the plan is built
           because that would be an invalid plan 
           and the planner would have to return "no plan available to meet the goal."
           No plan means no start, no start means no run-time exception.
           However, this problem could still occur while a plan is running
           if the system allowed the plan to be edited after it was started 
           ... and also allowed the editor to create an invalid plan.
   <br /><b>Prevention</b>: Do not allow invalid plans. (Warning: There is circular logic here.)
</p>

<p>
  <b>The task actions are assigned to actors.</b>
  <br />The actor assigned an action has the required role among its capabilities.
  If no actor can be found with the needed capability, something has gone wrong.
  For a plan to be valid at the time that it is started, 
  there must be at least one actor capable of performing every role in the plan.
  However, the actor could disappear or be disabled after the plan is started.  
  <br /><b>Detection</b>: When an actor is removed or disabled, 
        check each role.
        (Is the role viable? - Is there at least one actor with the role?)
   <br /><b>Prevention </b>:  When this is detected, 
         the business operator must assign the role to another actor.
         An alarm remains set until the problem is resolved.
</p>

<p>
  <b>The actor is assigned from a resource pool.</b>
  <br />Actors are generally assigned using a dynamic scheduling scheme.
     When the action is ready to start, the dispatcher asks the resource pools for bids.
     The action is assigned to the pool with the best (faster, cheaper, better) bid.
     If no resource pool can fulfill the requirement, there will be no bid.
     <br /><b>Detection</b>: All of the pools return "no bid". An alarm is set.
     <br /><b>Prevention</b>: This might occur if the set of requirements is too tight.
     <br /><b>Work-Around</b>: Loosen the requirements and re-bid.
     <br /><b>Failure Mode</b>: Cannot loosen further. Work is stalled.
</p>
<p>
  <b>The actor may consume various resources.</b>
  <br />An actor is a resource and consumes its own time.
        The action procedure may also cause the actor to consume or utilize other resources.
        If a resource is not available when it is needed, the actor is stalled.
        With modern inventory controls and a properly written plan, a "stock-out" should be rare. 
        Of course, problems can occur with production and delivery processes.
        <br /><b>Prevention</b>: The system can check for required resources before starting an action.
        This could even be done prior to the action being scheduled (bid) to prevent false bids.
        <br /><b>Failure Mode</b>: When dynamic scheduler asks for bids, 
         all pools response "no bid" because they all are short some resource. 
         (In some cases, there will be only one pool with the capability.)
         <br /><b>Detection</b>: Alarm is set when the system detects a high probability of a stock-out.
         (a probability threshold is set based on the consequences of the stock-out).
         The probability will become quite high when the inventory is down to a few items.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Inventory monitors order more material when re-order points are detected.</b>
   <br />Re-order points are calculated based on expected demand and expected time to replenish.
     Either of these expectations could be wrong and we run out of stock.
     <br /><b>Detection</b>: The system can continuously monitor the demand rate 
           and set an alarm if the rate deviates significantly from the norm.
     <br /><b>Failure Mode</b>: The supplier cannot deliver when expected. 
          The demand rate changes so fast we cannot compensate.  
</p>
<p>
  <b>An actor could become disabled while performing a step.</b>
  <br />When an actor is disabled (injured, sick, in need of repair, quit)
        it may be possible to assign the remainder of the action
        to another actor.
        However, this situation requires human intervention 
        - and that is what task exceptions are about.
        The intervention requires removing the disabled actor,
        replacing the actor with another actor (assuming the work can still be done),
        and deciding where to restart the action (assuming that the action is still advisable).
        <br /><b>Detection</b>: The actor signals "cannot continue" while working some step. 
              An alarm is set.
        <br /><b>Failure Mode</b>: The actor might not be able to send the signal.
              Eventually, the action step will time-out causing a time-out alarm to be set.
</p>
<p>
  <b>An actor could encounter an obstacle while performing a step.</b>
  <br />An actor might be a robot, a human, a work team, or a software actor. 
       Any actor might encounter an obstacle that prevents it from carrying out the current step.    
       For example, a vehicle could break down. 
       A vehicle could be caught in a traffic jam or encounter an accident. 
       A robot could detect a foreign object in its environment and halt for safety.
       <br /><b>Detection</b>: The actor signals "I am blocked" while working some step.
             An alarm is set.
       <br /><b>Work-Around</b>: Human intervention will be required 
             to assure that appropriate action is taken. 
             A replacement actor might be sent (on a different route). 
             (The step is re-started with a different actor assigned.) 
             The blockage might be removed by another agency. 
             (The step is re-started with the same actor in place.)
