<h2>Quad Data - a four dimensional database</h2>
<p>
Any data item can be identified with a three-level key:
<pre class="EXAMPLE">
    value = fc( object-id, attribute-id, time )
</pre>
</p><p>
In most business databases the time dimension is igored
and we get the current-time view:
<pre class="EXAMPLE">
    value = fc( object-id, attribute-id )
</pre>
</p><p>
The typical implementation in a relational system
stores a tuple where the position 
of the data is mapped to an attribute-id:
<pre class="EXAMPLE">
    ( object-id : value1, value2, value3, ... )
    maps to schema:
    class: ( id : attribute1, attr2, attr3, ...   )
</pre>
The tuple represents the "state-vector" of the object
at the current time.
</p><p>
This concept can be extended to include time
by adding a time-stamp to the key:
<pre class="EXAMPLE">
    ( object-id, time-stamp : value1, value2, value3, ... )
	
	event-log = fc( object-id, time-stamp )
</pre>
The time-stamp can be related to a specific event.
<br/>Thus both the time and the cause may be known.
</p><p>
Keeping the current-time view and the history in the same table
is usually too cumbersome. 
So, a typical optimization is to store the current-view
in one table and the historical view in another,
with the event-log on hand to provide context and audit trail:
<pre class="EXAMPLE">
    current view: ( object-id : value1, value2, value3, ... )
    history view: ( object-id, time-stamp : value1, value2, ... )
    causal event: ( time-stamp : who, did-what, where, when, ... )
</pre>
</p><p>
Relational systems assume that the table schema are static (change infrequently).
Basically, the database table must be closed 
while any schema changes are put into effect.
This works well enough as long as the schema does not change too frequently
and is well-understood.
</p><p>
But, what if the schema is not well-understood or it changes frequently?
The usual solution to this problem is to add the attribute to the key.
The relational realization of this concept is to model the tuple after the function:
<pre class="EXAMPLE">
    value = fc( object-id, attribute-id )
    becomes the triple:
    ( object-id, attribute-id : value )
</pre>
	Or, if we add the time dimension:
<pre class="EXAMPLE">
    value = fc( object-id, attribute-id, time )
    becomes the quad:
    ( object-id, attribute-id, time-stamp : value )
</pre>
And that 4-tuple is what we call a "quad".
The micro-fact that it represents is:
<br />"Attribute A of object O was assigned value V at time T." 
-- <code>quad: ( O, A, T : V) </code>
<br />
In a relational database we can achieve this idea with a table schema like:
<pre class="example">
quad: ( object, attribute, timeStamp1 : value, timeStamp2 )</code>
event: ( timeStamp : who,  what,        when,      where,   why  )
event: ( timeStamp : role, instruction, date-time, session, goal )
</pre>
... where timeStamp1 identifies the event that caused the value to be assigned,
and timeStamp2 identifies the event that caused a different value to be assigned.
</p>
<p class="AUTHOR"> 
   hmmm? What if the second event assigns the same value as the prior event?
   <br />Suggestion: If the second event occurs in a process that could,
     in principle, change the value of the attribute we treat it as updated
     even though the value is not changed. 
  Perhaps this means that the value is confirmed?
  There is a small problem of meta-physics here.    
  But the operational meaning is that
    we will not mark an attribute as changed 
    until its "setter" method is called.
