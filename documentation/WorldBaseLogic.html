Dialog: Questions about world-base concepts and features.
Context: World-Base Concepts and Features.
U: * world-base * ?
S: A world-base is like a data-base except that
     instead of operating at the level of tables and transactions,
     it operates at the level of entities, attributes, relationships, and events.
   The world-base is a temporal data-base and automatically provides event logs.  
   It can retrieve the past state of entities given a time-period of interest.
   The event logs indicate who changed which data and why.
 
U: * updated * ?
S: A world-base is updated whenever an event occurs
   in a run-time framework 
   which has attached the world-base
   to record its world model.

U: * event * ?
S: An event is any change in the state of the world.
   Events occur as a result of executing plans in the run-time framework.

U: * world  * ?
S: A world may be a real-world or a simulated world.
   For example, a real-world might be an operating business.
   A simulated world could be a game, a simulation of an environment,
     or a simulation of a businesss operation.

U: * quad * ?
S: A "quad" is a coined-word meaning a 4-tuple in the world-base.
   There are two kinds of quad: 
     one representing current state,
     and one representing historical state.
   Current: [ e, a : p, v ] where p = [ t-start, no end ].
   History: [ e, a, p : v ] where p = [ t-start, t-end  ].  
   In this notation:
   - e is an entity-instance identifier.
   - a is an attribute-type identifier.
   - p is a time-period.
   - v is some value. 
   The colon (:) separates the key from the data.

U: * schema * ?   
S: The data schema is *not* recorded in the world-base.
   It is recorded in the ~ontology~. 
   If an entity-type E has a set attribute-types {A},
     the entity schema is represented in the ontology as: [ E : {A} ].
   An attribute-type may be a complex-type, having attributes of its own;
     and, in effect, the complex-type is like an entity.
   Attribute-types are assumed to be 
     of ~data-type~ "string" unless declared otherwise.
   
U: * data-type * ?
S: The run-time handles the following data-types.
   - string    - Simply a string of characters.
   - measure   - A number with limited precision and unit of measure.
   - date-time - A specific point in the world-time.
   - duration  - A duration is a kind of measurement - a measure of time.
   - collection - A set or list of items of the same type.     

U: * relationships * ?
S: Relationships between entities are a type of object.
   They are "Associative Entities" in Entity-Relationship terminology.
   If B is a binary relationship between entity E1 in role R1
     and entity E2 in role R2,
     the quads would look like this:
   - [ B, R1, p, E1 ].  
   - [ B, R2, p, E2 ]. 
   Associative Entities may relate more than two roles
     and have additional attributes of their own.
   
U: * embedded * ?
U: * child * ?
U: * children * ?
U: * component * ?
U: * collection * ?
U: * set * ?
U: * list * ?
S: Consider an order that contains a list of order-items.
   In the Hum dictionary frames, 
     an entity-type may be declared 
     as containing a collection (a set or a list) 
     of some other entity-type.
   If the collection is a set, 
     the sequence in which the items are displayed is arbitrary
     and no item may appear more than once.  
   If the collection is a list,
     the sequence in which the items are displayed is fixed
     and the list may contain items with identical attributes.

Dictionary:
. An event contains a list of slots.
. A slot contains an event-role and an entity.
. . (Events represent entity updates and new relationships.)
. An entity contains a list of attributes.
. An entity contains a set of listeners. 
. . (A view will be a entity listener.)
. An entity-type contains a set of listeners. 
. . (An external world-base can be synchronized this way.)
. An entity-type contains a set of entities.
. An entity-type contains a list of attribute-types.
---
Role: World-Base.
Action: Process event.
. (An event contains a set of entities.)
. For each slot in event:
. . Update the entity.
. If the event contains more than one entity:
. . (The event represents a relationship.)
. . Create an associative entity to represent the indicated relationship.

To: Update an entity.
. (An entity contains a set of attributes.)
. For each attribute in entity data-set:
. . If the attribute has been changed:
. . . Update the attribute quad.
. . Else:
. . . Do nothing.
. Notify the entity-type listeners.
. Notify the entity listeners.

To: Update an attribute quad.
. Translate the current-state quad to history.
. Replace the current-state quad.

To: Translate the current-state quad to history.
. Input  [ e, a : p, v ], p = [t-start, null] from current-state
. Set t-end same as t-start of in-coming event.
. Output [ e, a, p : v ], p = [t-start, t-end] to history.

To: Replace the current-state quad.
. Input  [ e, a: p, v ], p = [t-start, null] from event.
. Output [ e, a: p, v ], p = [t-start, null] to current-state.
. (Does it make sense for an event to set t-end in the time-period?)

To: Notify the entity listeners.
. For each listner in the entity:
. . Send a data-event showing new entity-state to the listener.

To: Notify the entity-type listeners.
. For each listener in the entity-type:
. . For each entity in the entity-type:
. . . Send a data-event showing new entity-state to the listener.

Action: Register an entity-type listener.
. (Provide the means to synchronize external world-bases.)
. Add listener to the entity-type's list of listeners.

Action: Register an entity listener.
. (Provide means to inform views.)
. Add listener to the entity's list of listeners.

Action: Remove an entity listener.
. Remove listener from the entity's set of listeners.

Action: Remove an entity-type listener.
. Remove listener from the entity-type's set of listners.

Action: Send a data-event showing new entity-state to the listener.
. (A data-event is different from a world-event ... So, this is not recursive.)
. Create a data frame for the entity.
. Messenger: Send the data frame to the listener.

Action: Build a view-frame for an entity-type.
. For each attribute-type in the entity-type:
. . Create a label and a slot.

To: Create a label and a slot.
. Use the attribute-type's label as the view label.
. Create a slot appropriate to the attribute-type's data-type.
