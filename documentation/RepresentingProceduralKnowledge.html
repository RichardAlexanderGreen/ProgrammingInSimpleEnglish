<h1>Representing Procedural Knowledge</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Procedural knowledge can be presented as plan-trees, protocols (modal message exchanges), or as sequences of instructions. 
	It is not always obvious which is the "best" representation.
	We examine the alternatives for a simple case.
     </p>

<h2>Example: Bake a cake.</h2>
  <p>Consider the case where we want to represent the process knowledge involved when we back a cake. Typically, the first instruction in the <n>recipe</n> will be "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (Fahrenheit). While the oven is heating, we can grease the cake pan and mix the ingredients. This is a case where parallel processing is enabled. 
<br/>We can represent such knowledge using a <i>plan tree</i>.
     </p>
<h3>Plan Frames</h3>

<pre class="example" >
<k>Goal:</k> Bake a cake per <n>recipe</n>.
<k>Preconditions:</k>
. Oven is preheated to <n>oven-temperature</n> specified in <n>recipe</n>. 
. Cake <n>batter</n>, prepared per <n>recipe</n>, is in greased cake-pan.
<k>Action:</k>
. <r>Arm:</r> Place cake-pan in oven for time given in <n>recipe</n>.

<k>Goal:</k> Cake <n>batter</n>, prepared per <n>recipe</n>, is in greased cake-pan.
<k>Preconditions:</k>
. <h>Cake-pan is greased.</h>             
. <n>Batter</n> is prepared per <n>recipe</n>.   
<k>Action:</k>
. <r>Arm:</r> Pour <n>batter</n> from mixing-bowl into cake-pan.

<k>Goal:</k> Oven is preheated to <n>oven-temperature</n> specified in <n>recipe</n>.
<k>Preconditions:</k>
. <h>Oven heat is on.</h>
. <h>Oven thermostat is set to <n>oven-temperature</n>.</h>
<k>Action:</k>
. Oven: Signal when <n>oven-temperature</n> settles.

<k>Goal:</k> <n>Batter</n> is prepared per <n>recipe</n>.
<k>Preconditions:</k>
. <h>Cake <n>ingredients</n> required by <n>recipe</n> are assembled on mixing-counter.</h>
. <h>mixing-equipment clean and ready.</h>
<k>Action:</k>
. Mixer: Blend <n>ingredients</n>, giving <n>batter</n>.
</pre>
  <p>In the example above, the highlighted statements
      indicate goals that have no preconditions 
      and the subgoal can be achieved by executing an equivalent action statement.
     We could make this more concise by adapting the convention
	 that preconditions can be stated as actions. 
	<br/>(Actions are indicated by the role-prefix pattern: <code>&lt;role&gt;: &lt;action&gt;.</code>)
	 <br/>With that convention, the goal frames above become . . .
     </p>

<pre class="example" >
<k>Goal:</k> Bake a cake per <n>recipe</n>.
<k>Preconditions:</k>
. <h><r>Oven:</r> Preheat to <n>oven-temperature</n> specified in <n>recipe</n>.</h> 
. Cake <n>batter</n>, prepared per <n>recipe</n>, is in greased cake-pan.
<k>Action:</k>
. <r>Arm:</r> Place cake-pan in oven for time given in <n>recipe</n>.

<k>Goal:</k> Cake <n>batter</n>, prepared per <n>recipe</n>, is in greased cake-pan.
<k>Preconditions:</k>
. <h><r>Helper:</r> Grease cake-pan.</h>
. <n>Batter</n> is prepared per <n>recipe</n>. 
<k>Action:</k>
. <r>Arm:</r> Pour <n>batter</n> from mixing-bowl into cake-pan.

<k>Goal:</k> Oven is preheated to <n>oven-temperature</n> specified in <n>recipe</n>.
<k>Preconditions:</k>
. <h>Oven: Turn heat on.</h>
. <h>Oven: Set thermostat to <n>oven-temperature</n>.</h>
<k>Action:</k>
. Oven: Signal when <n>oven-temperature</n> settles.

<k>Goal:</k> <n>Batter</n> is prepared per <n>recipe</n>.
<k>Preconditions:</k>
. <h>Mixer: Assemble <n>ingredients</n> required by <n>recipe</n>.</h>
. <h>Mixer: Stage mixing-equipment.</h>
<k>Action:</k>
. Mixer: Blend <n>ingredients</n>, giving <n>batter</n>.
</pre>
  <p>I perceive three problems with this kind of condensation:
 <br/>1. It may encourage premature pruning of the plan tree -- enabling bad habits.
 <br/>2. It mixes assertion statements with action statements -- reducing readability.
 <br/>3. <h>Removing assertions disables certain kinds of reasoning and logic tools.</h>
     </p>


<h3>Action Frames</h3>
  <p>We can also represent this process knowledge as a sequence of instructions.
	But instructions in a sequence are implicitly blocking. 
	By representing the process in a sequence, we obscure the information that some things can happen in parallel. 
	Of course, an experienced human cook would know this and compensate. 
	But, what if our agent is a robot rather than a human cook? 
     </p>
<pre class="example">
<k>Role:</k> <r>Baker.</r>
<k>Action:</k> Bake a cake per <n>recipe</n>.
. <r>Oven:</r> Preheat to <n>oven-temperature</n> per <n>recipe</n>.
. <r>Helper:</r> Grease cake-pan.
. <r>Mixer:</r> Prepare <n>batter</n> per <n>recipe</n>.
. <r>Arm:</r> Pour <n>batter</n> into <n>cake-pan</n>.
. <r>Arm:</r> Place <n>cake-pan</n> in <n>oven</n> for time given in <n>recipe</n>.

(Example does not include stages beyond baking the cake.)
</pre>
  <p>We could use some convention to indicate "futures" . . .
	<br/>In the following, the "<b>giving</b> . . ." clause indicates a future.
	<br/>The compiler can furnish the needed semaphores for coordination.
     </p>
<pre class="example">
<k>Role:</k> <r>Baker.</r>
<k>Action:</k> Bake a cake per <n>recipe</n>.
. <r>Oven:</r> Preheat to <n>oven-temperature</n> per <n>recipe</n> <b>giving</b> preheated-oven.
. <r>Helper:</r> Grease cake-pan <b>giving</b> greased-cake-pan.
. <r>Mixer:</r> Mix ingredients per <n>recipe</n> <b>giving</b> <n>batter</n> .
. <r>Arm:</r> Pour <n>batter</n> into <n>cake-pan</n>.
. <r>Arm:</r> Place <n>cake-pan</n> in <n>oven</n> for time given in <n>recipe</n>
          <b>giving</b> baked-cake-in-pan.

(Example does not include stages beyond baking the cake.)
</pre>
  <p>The compiler could also analyze the statements (without the "giving" clauses)
		to infer that instructions delegated to different roles
		may be performed in parallel;
		but, instructions delegated to the same role must be performed in sequence.
	 The IDE might also analyze noun usage to provide hints about where giving clauses
	    might be appropriate.
     </p>
  <p>However, 
      I regard such ideas as "work-arounds" 
        that pollute the original semantic intent.
      Such ideas add still more ways to express the same process structure.
      Having more than one way to express a process makes a program harder to maintain 
		because the maintenance programmer may have to look in more than one place 
		to find the relevant code.
	  It also enables a situation where multiple programmers working in a major codebase
		may create confusion and entropy with a mix of programming styles and structures.
     </p>


<h3>Dialogs</h3>
  <p>Imagine a future where we script interactions between users and VR avatars.
     The notation below resembles that for a stage play.
	"U:" is shorthand for "User:" and shows patterns indicating user requests.
	"S:" is shorthand for "System:" and shows the system response.
	The system response may include setting plans in motion.
	Where an avatar may be available, avatar gestures may be indicated with annotation.
     </p>
  <p class="AUTHOR">
	Perhaps "Q:" and "A:" would be more evocative of request-response.
     </p>
  <p>Real-life dialogs are context-sensitive. 
     The dialog partner remembers what has been said before
       and responses are prioritized to match the most recently "pushed" context.
     </p>

<pre class="example">
Context: Guest at reception.           [Gesture: Watch guest.]

U: Hello.
U: Hi.
S: Hello. Welcome to Club Mech.  [Gesture: Smile.]

Context: Member at reception.

U: Hello.
U: Hi.
S: Hello [member name]. How may I help you?  [Gesture: Expecting answer.]
. Push context 'Member request'.

Context: Member request.

U: * account *.
S: Here is your current account statement. 
   All charges are up-to-date. Payments are posted when they are received.
. Show 'Member Account' view.
</pre>

  <p>Many user interfaces are based on paper document conventions.
	In the frame below we use show a view that uses a wiki-like mark-up
	  to indicate data slots and font emphasis.
     </p>

<pre class="example">
View: Member Account.
!! Account Statement for member: [member`s name] as of: [clock`s date-time] 

  Prior period balance: [prior-period`s balance]
     Payments received: [prior-period`s payment-total]
Current period balance: [current-period`s balance]

!!! Current Period Charges
. Table of member`s outstanding-charges:
| date-and-time | description | price |
. Subtotal price.

</pre>



<h2>Who is speaking to whom?</h2>
  <p>In traditional programming, 
       the programmer writes instruction sequences to be interpreted
       by a computer (a programmable calculator).
     The speaker (sender) is the programmer. 
     The listener (receiver) is the computer.
     User interfaces involve the programmer instructing the computer 
       about how to exchange messages with a human user.
     But the point-of-view still tends to be that of the programmer.
     "When user says this, do that."
     </p>
  <p>But in an enterprise context or in the internet of things (IoT),
      we may need to rethink the nature of programs.
     Instead of programmers speaking to computers,
       the more common mode is robots speaking to robots.
     The new point-of-view for the programmer
       is to write the scripts for those robot-to-robot communications.
     This requires changing the programmers point-of-view 
        to that of one of the robot actors.
