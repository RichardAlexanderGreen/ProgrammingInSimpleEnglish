<h1>The future of the user interface.</h1>

<h2>The system's avatar speaks for the system.</h2>
  <p>In Hum, the avatar represents the system to the end-user.
     It speaks the system's lines in a dialog frame. 
  </p>
  <p>Future user interfaces are likely to be more speech oriented
     and significantly less text oriented.
     Text may still be used as a display advice - to record the fill-in the blank responses
     when several data slots must be filled-in simultaneously. 
  </p>
  
<h2>Existing Advanced User Interfaces</h2>
  <p>
     The future of computing is often predicted by looking at gaming frameworks.
     A business operation is a kind of multi-person game.
     The Second Life framework is a possible indicator of future user interfaces.
     It provides an interesting environment with social - not just individual interactions.
     One of it's interesting features is that the user can choose a style theme. 
     The implication for business in Second Life, 
     is that a business might need to conform
     to different virtual cultures (style themes) 
     in its VR outlets.
  </p>
  <p>The Croquet Project is a good indicator of how the virtual reality
     concept can be applied in a business environment. 
     While Second Life seems to be designed 
     with chat, entertainment, and the 3D artist in mind,
     The Croquet framework (Tea Time) is designed with collaboration in mind.
     This seems a more relevant focus for future business environments.
  </p>
  
<h2>Customer-Oriented versus Worker-Oriented</h2>
  <p>
     However, perhaps there is a split between customer-oriented interfaces,
     where the business wants to constrain the customer's interactions
     and worker-oriented interfaces
     where the business wants to amplify and enhance the worker's interactions.
     This could indicate a possible difference in the organization
     of the frameworks.
     For example, a customer-oriented interface may prefer to place the customer
     in a passive role with limited responses available to the customer.
     But the purpose of a collaboration environment 
     is to encourage active participation.
  </p>
  <p>The consequence of this simplestic dichotomy <i>may</i> be simple enough. 
     We might simply discover that a front-desk metaphor will suffice 
     for customer-oriented interfaces 
     and that something like a shared white-board might work well
     for a collaboration environment.
     In a virtual world, one also has the possibility of using the third dimension
     for display and, potentially, for collaboration.
     The third dimension makes three dimensional surface graphs feasible.
     It also makes walk-through presentations possible.
     (However, a walk-through is much like a slide-show,
     but with a slightly different metaphor.)
  </p>
  <p>The shared white-board already exists on the internet, but is rarely used.
     Why not? 
     Perhaps it is because very few people have access to pen interfaces
     and so the usual hand-writing, hand-drawing instrument is missing
     from the environment.
     However, typing and mouse-driven drawing is available, and yet rarely used.
     Could it be a kind of microphone fright? 
     Could it be that most people are uncomfortable with the tool?
     Perhaps this environment needs some additional usability engineering.

<h2>Consequences for Dialog Actors</h2>
  <p>  The current user interface design has two modes of communication: 
     </br>[1] <b>Dialog Mode</b> - a series of questions and answers.
     </br>[2] <b>View Mode</b> - a paper-form metaphor - like a HTML form. 
     A dialog is a goal generator. 
     It provides the user with a way to invoke plans.
     An initial dialog is invoked by a set-up. 
     (Set-up of a site or VR proximity detector.) 
     A view is used to gather data when needed.
     A view frame is invoked by a dialog or a plan when new data is needed
     or existing data must be confirmed.
  </p>
  <p>  The <b>Dialog Mode</b> is suitable for a VR environment or a simple 2D chat bot.
    The Dialog Mode can also be extended to respond to sensors in the VR environment.
    For example, a sensor such as a slider widget or a VR proximity detector
    could invoke dialogs which, in turn, invoke actor instructions. 
  </p>
  <p>  The <b>View Mode</b> provides backwards compatibility 
    with the existing form-based metaphor that is used 
    to display and gather data in many computer environments.
    In those environments, the View Frame can be translated into the usual HTML form
    or the equivalent widgets in other GUI frameworks.
    In the Croquet VR framework, the keyboard is still usable,
    and users can fill in a form by typing.
    While the user is typing, 
    the VR display shows a laser-like ray of light 
    connecting the user's avatar to the form
    to indicate the actor and the action.
  </p>
  <p>  <b>Dialog Actors</b> - Dialog actors operate dialogs and views.
    The system's dialog actor is assigned when the application is set-up.
    (Technically, an actor-factory is identified 
      in the application configuration
      and the factory creates actor instances
      to work each user session when the session starts.)
    The actor must inter-operate with the display framework 
      that is also part of the configuration.
  </p>
  <p>In a web environment, the Dialog Actor becomes a servlet or applet.
    In a desktop environment, the Dialog Actor operates one or more windows.
    In a VR environment, the Dialog Actor may operate an avatar in Dialog Mode.
    In View Mode, the Dialog Actor may cause a Form-Object 
      to be spawned in the VR
      or on the user's console.
    The Form-Object would then signal the Dialog Actor 
      when the form has something to report. (For example, submit button is pressed.)
    It is possible that the user's avatar could pass the form to the system's avatar.  
  </p>
  <p> The usability problem with the Dialog Actor is the awkwardness
    of current document-centric user interface metaphors.
    This is made worse by the nature of the web-server, web-browser framework.
    If a Simple Enlish application is deployed on the web,
      there are two options - fight it or join it.
    To fight it, the application would deploy its own client 
      becoming a client-server architecture.
    To join it, the application would work through the existing web browser framework
      and deploy its own application server.
    While working via a web browser, 
      the dialog actor could operate as a servlet or as an applet.
    Operating as an applet would be the preferred implementation
      because more interface options are available
      and the response to the user's inputs can be instantaneous.   
  </p>
  <p> The Hum language can be translated via code generators
      to other suitable programming languages.
    That means that the choice of an application framework
      implies a corresponding code generator and run-time.
    <ul>
      <li> To operate in the web environment,
           view frames can be translated to HTML forms or applet swing widgets.
           The run-time would then be a kind of application server on the web host.    
           </li>
      <li>To operate in a desktop environment,
            view frames can be translated to VB or C# forms or to swing widgets.
          The run-time would then be a kind of desktop application.  
          </li>
      <li>To operate in the Croquet Tea Time VR environment,
            view frames can be translated to equivalent Tea Time widgets.
          The run-time would be an extension of the Tea Time system.
          </li>
     </ul>
