brain storm something like this:<br>

<h3>The Software Engineer's View of the Future:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Eventually the user interface is a virtual reality scene.<br>
<!-- 
Currently the client-side browsers cannot provide 3D experiences.<br>
But they can provide some degree of 2D experience.<br>
At present, the user preference is for speed<br>
and that tends to steer the UI design to a menu metaphor.<br> 
-->
  </li>
  <li>The user may discuss their needs and desires with a bot in the scene.<br>
<!--
The programming technology for this kind of dialog processing is now usable.<br>
-->
  </li>
  <li>The bot interprets requests and translates those to application commands.</li>
  <li>Application commands are routed to SimpleEnglish framework.</li>
  <li>The framework takes the commands as goals and creates plans to meet the goals.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The SimpleEnglish task-master executes the resulting plan.</li>
  <li>The task-master informs the communication-actor (com-actor) as the plan steps are executed.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The com-actor (UI) can provide feedback as needed to the user.<br>
If the user is still in the virtual reality scene, the feedback could
be provided using scene action metaphors or simply communicated
verbally by a bot.<br>
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>Programming:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><p><b>User Story:</b> 
  The user story describes the interactions between the parties.<br>
Each sentence describes a <b>dialog</b>. 
The dialogs will be programmed in a <b>dialog language</b>. 
<i>(Perhaps a SimpleEnglish re-styling of AIML augmented with SimpleTemplate.)</i>

  <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Test Plan:</b> The user story forms a high-level test plan.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Business Process: </b>Business processes are described by a plan-base <br>
containing task-frames that describe individual processes.&nbsp; <br>
The goal: "We ship purchased items to customer."<br>
matches the title of a task frame<br>
that describes the end-game moves in the business process.<br>

<h3>The Operating Environment</h3>


<ul>


  <li><b>Run-Time System:</b> The framework simply communicates each
action in the task-plan to an actor, a software actor. The actor, in
turn, may communicate to other actors or a robot or a human worker.
When instructions are given to a human worker, a task-appropriate human
interface is used. The human interface could be a sheet of paper, a
mobile display, an interactive voice response system, or a virtual
reality display with 3D metophors. <br>
- The system may be highly distributed involving many actors hosted on
geographically dispersed hosts. Coordination is all asynchronous using
secure messaging. The messages contain SimpleEnglish sentences.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Accounting:</b> Actors are using resources and moving assets
around. Accounting is built-into the statement-understanding and
process instrumentation. The general ledger operates in real-time.</li>
  <li><b>Memory and History:</b>&nbsp; Programmers will delegate
record-keeping to the framework. They will no longer need to spend time
assuring that the recording system is functioning. Agents have only a
small amount of current data to remember - very simple persistance
systems will handle that. Businesses will use off-the-shelf "appliance"
systems to record and retrieve facts about customers, suppliers,
resources, and accounts. <br>
</li>
  <li><b>Component Architecture:</b> The essential components of the system include:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Human Interface Agent - communicates with human clients and workers<br>
    </li>
    <li>Accounting Service - operates accounting services, general ledger<br>
    </li>
    <li>Contact Database - tracks people and parties<br>
    </li>
    <li>Plan KnowledgeBase - stores the business process representation<br>
    </li>
    <li>Task Master - runs each task to completion or termination<br>
    </li>
    <li>Plan Maker - builds a plan for each goal<br>
    </li>
    <li>Resource Pool (class) - supertype for all resource pools: allocates, assigns, tracks<br>
    </li>
    <li>Resource (class) - supertype for all resources<br>
    </li>
    <li>Actor (class) - a resource that can perform action statements<br>
    </li>
    <li>Utilization db - hold resource utilization statistics, facilitates Monte Carlo draws.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>

</ul>


<h3>Consequences:</h3>


<ul>


  <li><b>Business Strategy:</b> Business process excellence will not
distinguish most competitors. The buying experience is already the thing that
differentiates brands in the consumer's minds. Branding will merge with the customer
experience. The customer experience will occur in the virtual reality store-front.&nbsp; This means that the ability to create
satisfying experiences, perhaps with some entertainment thrown in, will
be essential to building brand loyalty. <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Strategic advantage</b> will be based
on understanding customer preferences and being able to provide
customers with a delightful experience in addition to the old
strategies concerning market position, supply logistics, and the
ability to predict and respond to changes.</li>
  <li><b>Knowledge Economy:</b> Most business processes are not
unique.&nbsp; Warehouse and retail operations are well understood. The
generic top-level business processes for retail operations and shipping
and transportation will all be defined in a the first few months after
the SimpleEnglish framework is released. <br>
- The more critical knowledge will be an <b>understanding of customer preferences</b>.
In markets where the customers are young people, preferences will be
relatively volatile. One might expect that services that can profile
consumers in a way that allows bots to customize their behaviors might
be highly valued.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Talent Economy:</b> Initially the critical new knowledge will
be the ability to continuously provide satisfying buyer experiences.
This means creating interesting scenes and responsive bots. It appears
that this will require far more artistic talent and perhaps somewhat
less technical talent than has been the case in the past. <br>
- Currently, the work of creating highly detailed 3D scenery is very
labor intensive. One might therefore expect much of this work to flow
to places where labor is less expensive. <br>
- The work of creating good dialog requires a very good sense of local
verbal idiom - including, perhaps, a good sense of the customer's
cultural preferences. In the case of youth culture, this may require a
good ability to follow and imitate fads. This type of work is likely to
require a culturally sensitive and hence somewhat local work-force. (I
am only somewhat ignoring the fact that there is a global youth
culture.)</li>
