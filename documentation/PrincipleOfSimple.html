<h1>The Principle of Simple</h1>
<h3>Problem-space complexity is conserved.</h3>
<p>
      Complexity is conserved. 
<br />You can hide it. 
<br />You can abstract it. 
<br />You can defer dealing with it. 
<br />But, you cannot get rid of it.
      [<a href="#1">1</a>] 
<br />Some irreducible complexity is there in the problem space, 
      <br/>and eventually, 
           that complexity must be represented in the solution space. 
      [<a href="#2">2</a>] 

</p>
<h3>The trick is to avoid adding unneeded complexity in the solution space.</h3>
<p>
   While the complexity of the problem space is conserved,
   <br />a good tool does not add unneeded complexity. 
   <br />What does this mean?
</p>
<ul>
  <li>First of all, 
      the tool should provide a simple way of representing the problem space. 
      <br />The notation should offer good <i>fidelity</i>. 
      <br />- It does not distort the basic facts of the problem space 
              by recasting them into an awkward or esoteric representation.
  </li>
  <li>Secondly, the different <i>facets</i> of the problem space 
      <br />should remain different facets in the solution space. 
      <br />For example: The domain model is not mixed 
           with the presentation model.
  </li>
  <li>Thirdly, the tool should be <i>transparent</i>. 
      <br />What does that mean? 
      <br />It means that the tool does not produce problems of its own. 
      <br />It should not add artifacts to the problem space descriptions.
      <br />It should not obscure the facts of the problem space
              by translating them into an obscure notation.
  </li>
  <li>Finally, 
      simple recurring problems should have nearly <i>automatic solutions</i>.
      <br />Once the problem statement is complete, 
            the solution should be a push-button away. 
      <br />For example, 
            if the presentation problem is 
            to display a few related domain entities in an update mode, 
            the display should be automatically produced 
            along with the needed logic for updating the data store.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Hum avoids unneeded complexity and obscure notations.</h3>
<p>
   Hum does have notations 
   - but they are designed to be as natural as we could make them.
   The notations provide a regimen for organizing knowledge.
   But the regimen is as simple as we could make it.
</p>
<p>
   The most esoteric notation in Hum is the mark-up notation
     used to advise the user interface actors.
   We have attempted to keep the mark-up notation minimal but adequate.  
   Hopefully, this might be hidden from view some day
     when a WYSIWYG editor will obviate the need for people to know this notation.   
</p>
<!--
  We have invented our own mark-up which is similar to some wiki mark-up notations.
  This is probably a mistake.
  However, most of the mark-ups we evaluated 
    seemed to be even more esoteric than ours.

   We deliberately ignore situations where people 
     have created a self-inflicted complexity in the problem space
     and that complexity might be removed from the problem space
     by process re-engineering or policy reform.
   Consider, for example, the (USA) federal tax code. 
</p>
<p><a name="2">[2]</a> 
   The principle is that the solution designers must acknowledge and represent 
     whatever complexity exists in the problem space.
