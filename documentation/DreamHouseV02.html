  This is a STUDY of how data frames could be used to define a <b>landscape</b>.
  <br/>Obviously, it assumes a subsystem that can interpret this data
    (translate to a scene-graph language) 
    and a subsystem that can provide visualization.
  <br/>I wrote this with two questions on my mind: 
  <br/>[1] Is the data frame notation sufficiently robust to define a scene graph?
  <br/>[2] Can I think of a landscape that would interest a girl?
