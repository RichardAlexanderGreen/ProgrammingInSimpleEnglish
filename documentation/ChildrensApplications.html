<h2> Children's Applications using Hum framework</h2>

<h3>Interactive Fiction</h3>
<p>
  Dialog frames can be used to construct the vignettes of an interactive fiction. 
  <br />- The system half of the dialog would be mostly scene descriptions.
  <br />- Instructions could be used to alter player properties 
  			and initiate game environment actions.
  <br />- The user half of the dialog would be moves.
</p>

<h3>Robotics</h3>
<p> 
  Task Frames and Role Frames can be used to program virtual robots.
  <br />- For this to work, there has to be a way to view the action.
  <br />- Can these programs be transferred to real robots? 
  			(Certainly. But the real robot must have required capability.)
  <br />- Imagine a kind of "battle bot" game. 
  			Fleet versus fleet seems do-able. 
  			(This would require codifying a set of sensors.)
</p>

<h3>Turtle Art</h3>
<p>
   Action frames could be used to direct the turtle.
   <br />- The actions could be recorded, saved, re-played.
   <br />- Fractals could be created by recursion 
   			with programmed variation of parameters.
</p>

<h3>Dream House</h3>
<p> 
  Data frames, following a pre-defined protocol, 
  	could be used to describe a series of walls, windows, and doors.
  <br />- This would not be interesting without immediate visual feedback.
  <br />- Manufacturers could enhance this 
  			with self-drawing catalogs of their components.
</p>

<h3>Stage Play</h3>
<p>
  Stage Plays could be scripted 
  	and simulated using a small evolution of dialog frames. 
  <br />- Dialog frames assume two "actors" ... user and system.
  	We could define a "Script Frame" to allow multiple actors, 
  		some interactions with properties, and movement on the set.
    The roles can be assigned to avatar agents 
    	who would appear and move as the script directs.    
</p>

<h3>Screen Play</h3>
<p>
  A screen play is like a stage play 
  - but it adds the complication of manipulating the camera. 
</p>

<h3>Choreography</h3>
<p>
   This is like a stage play except that the actors' moves need to be coordinated
     with a score. 
</p>

<h3>Solid Modeling</h3>
<p>
   Again, data frames, following a  pre-defined (elaborate VRML-like) protocol,
     could be used to describe various solids.
   <br />- Again, this would not be interesting without immediate visual feedback. 
</p>

<h3>Dream Car</h3>
<p>
    The trick here might be to start with a basic car and then allow the designer
    to "morph" it by tinkering with parameters or modifying curves.
