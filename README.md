==========================

How to write programs in English - no algebra required.

The Hum programming language and framework is designed as a kind of DSL 
that enables one to write business programs using English language syntax.

Note: The files with an ".st" extension were created by a Squeak file-out process. 
They may be imported into Squeak or Pharo  with a file-in command.

See the wiki for additional wiki-style documentation of the language and concepts.
