<h2>Thoughts about Hum`s User Interface Architecture</h2>
  <p>Designing and Constructing the Hum user interface (UI) architecture
	has been the most challenging task in creating the Hum run-time infrastructure.
	The problem is made more difficult due to the lack of separation between model and presentation that we currently see in the (non-Hum) programming frameworks.
     </p>
  <p>The basic strategy behind the Hum user interface architecture
	is that it should be technology independent at the level of the dialog vignette.
	This allows vignettes to be expressed as English-like dialogs 
	(stimulus-response scripts)
	that do not need to reference sensors.
	
     </p>
  <p>User dialogs are managed by a Dialog Agent.
	The Dialog Agent remembers the context and initiates requested actions.
	Sensors are managed by a "Scribe".
	The Dialog Agent interacts with a "Scribe" actor. 
	A Scribe implementation mediates a specific user interface technology
	and translates user interface (sensor) inputs
	into sentences that match vignette patterns.
     </p>
<h3>What does a scribe do?</h3>
  <p>
	A Scribe listens to the user interface "sensorium" and translates user inputs
	into dialog-vignette sentences.
	With an conventional (HTML) user interface, 
		this means that a keyboard entry may be translated directly
		while a mouse click may be translated into a sentence.
	In an virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR) user interface,
		the Scribe might translate position sensor input into text 
		such as "Approaching ..." or "Facing ..."
     </p>

<h3>How are scribes implemented?</h3>
	  <p>
	While a Scribe might be implemented from scratch in some programming language,
	it seems easier to create gesture-recognizers in the user interface framework`s primary programming language. 
	In HTML, this implies that the Scribe`s gesture-recognizers will be written largely in JavaScript because they are client-side.
	The server-side language can be any language with a <i>Hum binding</i>.
	The Hum binding implements Hum`s actor framework.
	Hum`s actor framework is a relatively simple asynchronous messaging protocol.

<h4>Is a dialog vignette just a design notation?</h4>
  <p>
	A contemporary (2015) programmer will tend to think of the vignette notation 
	as a kind of <i>design notation</i>.
	The user interface still needs to be programmed in detail.
	There is an incomplete code generator that generates an HTML form code-fragment,
	but that is the only tool. 
	<highlight>
    For Hum to be demonstration-able (demo-able) and taken seriously, 
	 it needs a competent user interface in at least one popular UI framework. 
	</highlight>
     </p>
<h5>Programmer`s Tools - Code Generators and API</h5>
  <p>
	An API of some sort is always present in the user interface framework.
	The API may implement a DSL (design-specific language) for the user-interface directly
	or a separate DSL may be interpreted or translated to produce the user-interface.
	Code generators (DSL translators) are almost always coupled to a specific API.
	 </p>


<h3>Why do I get stuck on the user interface? </h3>
  <p>
	I keep getting stuck in the vicinity of the user interface.
	I've implemented a crude and incomplete Hum View to HTML form translator.
	But, I have not implemented a complete HTML Scribe 
	... mainly because I do not like programming in JavaScript.
     </p>
<hr/>
Following added 30-Aug-2016:
  <p style="color:RED">
	 I need to produce a reasonably complete Scribe in order to provide a proof-of-concept
		for myself and any readers.
	<br/>- One of the missing features is the dialog connection. This resembles a chat-bot interface and could be built using an HTML form or an AJAX component.
	<highlight>
   	<br/>- The existing HTML generator needs to be refactored into a Scribe API.	
	</highlight>
    
     </p>
<h2>Thoughts added after seeing a Ruby lecture</h2>
  <p>I go to such lectures to keep in touch with the problem-sets 
	that real-life programmers need to handle.
     </p>

<h3>Demo: ToDo List application - proof-of-concept</h3>
	  <p>A "ToDo List" is a simple application with an interactive table.
		It should be a kind of "hello world" for every framework.
		The user needs C.R.U.D. capability for each todo-list entry.
		I need to set up a proof-of-concept implementation 
		that 
		<br/>(1) provides a usable interface 
		and 
		<br/>(2) updates a world-base.
     </p>
<h3>How might special HTML code be represented in View markup?</h3>
	  <p>There are three problems:
		<br/>(1) adding links to &lt;head&gt; section.
		<br/>(2) embedding special attributes in Hum-generated HTML tags.
		<br/> . . Of course, programmers can augment the existing HTML code generator.
		<br/> . . Consider this extension to markup syntax: [pane: heading; (attributes)]
		<br/> . . . Programmers would place tag attributes after semi-colon.
		<br/> . . . Special case: <code>class="formatClass"</code> would be merged into HUM class attribute value.
		<br/>(3) embedding icons and such in otherwise innocent text.
     </p>
	  <p style="color:blue">
		I should also ask myself if this is a case of the <u>tail wagging the dog</u>.
		<br/>The problem with code-generators is that they seem to need to know too much.
		<br/>Perhaps this is a problem I should simply ignore. I could provide one good-enough code-generator and leave it to user-programmers to extend the generator for special cases. Of course, they would only have an incentive where the "special cases" were re-usable.
     </p>
	

<h3>Think: Who does world-base trust? and why?</h3>
	 <p>Who does an actor trust to invoke its methods?
		<br/>Should that be delegated to a dispatcher?
		<br/>In some cases a client may be invalidated (e.g. late payments).
     </p>
	 <p>The world-base is intended to be the source of truth.
		<br/>That implies a circle of trust.
		<br/>Since new data values come from DialogAgents,
		we need rules and/or processes for validating (authenticating and authorizing) DialogAgent actors.
		(We might also need to validate Scribes.)
     </p>
     <p>But Dialog Agents are proxies for Clients.
		So the question becomes the usual one about how do you validate a client.
		That means we can delegate the question of client trust to the UI and network framework (e.g. certificates, et cetera) as we would for any HTTP application.
     </p>

<h3>Who does the Dispatcher trust? and why?</h3>
  	<p>Agents "check-in" with the dispatcher and identify the roles they "know".
	<br/>In Erlang OTP, there is no built-in authentication. 
		Perhaps, we need an authentication option in Hum 
			that is independent of the backend implementation.
		The check-in protocol could be extended to provide a signature or something.
		We could copy the signature ideas used in SOAP framework.
		(avoid re-inventing this)

  <p>Think about use cases for "broadcast" publish (unknown subscribers).
